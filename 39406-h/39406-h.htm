<p>Mr. Townsend's fellow countrymen must feel themselves
to be put under a beautiful obligation to him by his work
entitled <i>Kentucky in American Letters</i>. He has thus
fenced off for the lovers of New World literature a well
watered bluegrass pasture of prose and verse, which
they may enter and range through according to their appetites
for its peculiar green provender and their thirst
for the limestone spring. This strip of pasture is a hundred
years long; its breadth may not be politely questioned!</p>

<p>For the backward-looking and for the forward-looking
students of American literature, not its merely browsing
readers, he has wrought a service of larger and more
lasting account. Whether his patiently done and richly
crowned work be the first of its class and kind, there is
slight need to consider here: fitly enough it might be a
pioneer, a path-blazer, as coming from the land of pioneers,
path-blazers.</p>

<p>But whether or not other works of like character be already
in the field of national observation, it is inevitable
that many others soon will be. There must in time and in
the natural course of events come about a complete marshalling
of the American commonwealths, especially of
the older American commonwealths, attended each by its
women and men of letters; with the final result that the
entire pageant of our literary creativeness as a people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
will thus be exhibited and reviewed within those barriers
and divisions, which from the beginning have constituted
the peculiar genius of our civilization.</p>

<p>When this has been done, when the States have severally
made their profoundly significant showing, when the
evidence up to some century mark or half-century mark
is all presented, then for the first time we, as a reading
and thoughtful self-studying people, may for the first
time be advanced to the position of beginning to understand
what as a whole our cis-Atlantic branch of English
literature really is.</p>

<p>Thus Mr. Townsend's work and the work of his fellow-craftsmen
are all stations on the long road but the right
road. They are aids to the marshalling of the American
commonwealths at a great meeting-point of the higher influences
of our nation.</p>

<p>Now, already American literature has long been a subject
in regard to which a library of books has been written.
The authors of by far the most of these books are
themselves Americans, and they have thus looked at our
literature and at our civilization from within; the authors
of the rest are foreigners who have investigated
and philosophized from the outside. Altogether, native
and foreign, they have approached their theme from divergent
directions, with diverse aims, and under the influence
of deep differences in their critical methods and
in their own natures. But so far as the writer of these
words is aware, no one of them either native or foreign
has ever set about the study of American literature, enlightened
with the only solvent principle that can ever
furnish its solution.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span></p>

<p>That solvent principle is contained within a single
proposition. That single proposition is the one upon
which our forefathers deliberately chose to found the civilization
of the Anglo-Saxon race in the New World: that
it should not be a civilization of States which were not a
Nation; that it should not be the civilization of a nation
without states; but that it should be a Nation of States.</p>

<p>Now, if any man aspires to draw from American literature
the philosophy of its traits, if he sets it as the goal
of his wisdom to explain its breadth and its narrowness,
its plenty here and its lack there, its color in one place
and its pallor in another, let him go back to the will of
the fathers in the foundation of the Republic and find the
explanation of our literature at the basis of our whole
civilization. He will never find it anywhere else. He
will find it there as he there finds the origin of our system
of government, of our system of industry, of our system
of political barriers, of our system of education: in the
entire nature of our institutions as derived and unfolded
from the idea that we should be a nation of states. Our
literature&mdash;our novels and our poetry&mdash;have been as
rigorously included in this development as all the other
elements of our life.</p>

<p>For the first time in this way he may come to see a
great light; and with that light shining about him he may
be prepared to write the first history of American literature.</p>

<p>None has yet been written.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p class="center">I</p>

<p>What is a Kentucky book, is the one great question
this work has elicited. Surely a Kentucky book is
one written by a Kentuckian about Kentucky or Kentuckians
and printed in Kentucky; surely it is a book written
by a Kentuckian upon any subject under the sun, and
published in any clime; surely it is one written in Kentucky
by a citizen of any other state or country, regardless
of the subject or place of publication, for, "in general,
I have regarded the birthplace of a piece of literature
more important than that of the author." But is a book,
though treating of Kentucky or Kentuckians, regardless
of its place of publication, whose author was not born in,
nor for any appreciable period resided in, this state, entitled
to be properly classified as a Kentucky work? The
writer has responded in the negative to this question in
the present work.</p>

<p>There have been several noted American authors who
have written volumes about Kentucky or Kentuckians,
and they themselves were not natives of this state, nor resided
within its confines. Those early Western travelers
rarely omitted Kentucky from their journeys. The first
of them, F. A. Michaux, published his famous <i>Travels
to the West of the Alleghany Mountains, in the States of
Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee</i>, at London, in 1805; two
years later F. Cuming's <i>Tour to the Western Country,
through Ohio and Kentucky</i>, was printed at Pittsburg;
and in 1817 John Bradbury got out the first edition of his
now noted <i>Travels in the Interior of America</i>, at London.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
Bradbury died in 1823 and to-day lies buried in
the cemetery at Middletown, Kentucky, near Louisville.
George W. Ogden's <i>Letters from the West</i> (New Bedford,
1823); W. Bullock's <i>Sketch of a Journey through
the Western States</i> (London, 1827); and Tilly Buttrick's
<i>Voyages, Travels, and Discoveries</i> (Boston, 1831), round
out fairly well that group of Scotchmen, Englishmen,
New Englanders, and what not, who found many interesting
things in Kentucky a hundred years and more
ago. Ogden spent two summers in Kentucky; Bullock
owned a river-side tract near Ludlow, Kentucky, and
old Bradbury sleeps in a quiet Kentucky hamlet, but
neither of them may be properly classified as a real
Kentuckian.</p>

<p>The Beauchamp-Sharp tragedy of 1825 was the one
Kentucky event that kindled the imaginations of more
alien writers than any other happening in our history.
Edgar Allan Poe, William Gilmore Simms, Charles Fenno
Hoffman, G. P. R. James, James Hall, and several
others, wrote plays, novels, and poems based upon this
tragedy. In 1832 James Kirke Paulding, the friend of
Washington Irving, published one of the earliest Kentucky
romances, entitled <i>Westward Ho!</i> which name he
got from the old Elizabethan drama of John Webster and
Thomas Dekker. Two years after the appearance of
Paulding's tale, William A. Caruthers, the Virginia
novelist, printed <i>The Kentuckian in New York</i>; and in
the same year Thomas Chandler Haliburton ("Sam
Slick"), put forth one of his earliest works, <i>Kentucky, a
Tale</i> (London, 1834). In 1845 Charles Winterfield's <i>My
First Days With the Rangers</i>, appeared, to be followed
the next year by William T. Porter's <i>A Quarter Race in
Kentucky</i>.</p>

<p>These writers hardly did more than point the way to
Kentucky for Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe, whose world-famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
novel, <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> (Boston, 1852), was set
against a background of slave-holding Kentucky. This is
the most famous example our literature affords of a
writer of another state or country coming to Kentucky
for the materials out of which to build a book.</p>

<p>In 1860 David Ross Locke, the Ohio journalist and
satirist, discovered the <i>Rev. Petroleum V. Nasby</i>, postmaster
at "Confedrit X Roads, Kentucky," and his political
satires on Kentucky, the <i>Nasby Letters</i>, tickled
the readers of his paper, <i>The Toledo Blade</i>, through
many years. These alleged communications from poor
Petroleum may be read to-day in Locke's <i>Swingin' Round
the Cirkel</i>, and <i>Ekkoes from Kentucky</i>. J. G. Marshall's
<i>The Outlaw Brothers</i> (New York, 1864); Miss
Martha Remick's <i>Millicent Halford: a Tale of the Dark
Days of Kentucky in the year 1861</i> (Boston, 1865); two
novels by Edward Willett, entitled <i>Kentucky Border
Foes</i>, and <i>Old Honesty: a Tale of the Early Days of Kentucky</i>,
both of which were issued in the late sixties; Constance
F. Woolson's <i>Two Women</i> (New York, 1877), and
Mrs. Anna Bowman Dodd's story, <i>Glorinda</i> (Boston,
1888), concludes the group of writers of the comparatively
modern school who did not linger long in the "meadowland,"
but who found it good literary soil, and helped
themselves accordingly.</p>

<p>In recent years Mr. Winston Churchill's <i>The Crossing</i>,
Dr. James Ball Naylor's <i>The Kentuckian</i>, Mr. Augustus
Thomas's <i>The Witching Hour</i>, and the Kentucky lyrics
of Mrs. Alice Williams Brotherton, the Ohio poet, have
drawn fresh attention to Kentucky as a background for
literary productions, although they are written by those
who cannot qualify as Kentuckians. But to claim any
of these writers for the Commonwealth, would be to make
one's self absurd. Dr. Naylor's lines upon this point
are <i>apropos</i>:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I must admit&mdash;although it hurts!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That I was born unlucky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've never, literally, had<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A home in Old Kentucky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet I feel should wayward Chance<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Direct my steps to roam there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'd meet you all and greet you all&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And find myself <i>at home</i> there!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As has already been indicated, the good physician-poet
is not by any manner of means the only alien bard who
has remembered Kentucky in his work. No less a poet
than the great Sir Walter Scott celebrated Kentucky in
<i>Marmion</i>&mdash;the State's first appearance in English poetry.
The passage may be found near the close of the ninth
stanza in the third canto. Lord Marmion and his followers
have ridden "the livelong day," and are now quartered
at a well-known Scottish hostelry. They have all
eaten and drunk until they are on the borderland of
dreams when their leader, seeing their condition,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">... called upon a squire:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Fitz-Eustace, know'st thou not some lay,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">We slumber by the fire."&mdash;<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"So please you," thus the youth rejoined<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>And while Fitz realizes that he cannot, in any degree,
equal the famous singer to whom he has referred, he now
further praises him, calls down curses on the cause that
kept him from following Marmion, and ventures</p>

</div></div>

<p>After Sir Walter, the next English poet to tell the
world of Kentucky and one of her sons, was George Gordon
(Lord) Byron. His references are found in the eighth
canto and the sixty-first to the sixty-seventh stanzas inclusive,
of <i>Don Juan</i>. This poem was begun in 1819 and
published, several cantos at a time, until the final sixteenth
appeared in 1824. The sixty-first stanza will serve
our purpose.</p>

<p>In 1827 Alfred Tennyson, with his brother Charles,
published a slender sheaf of juvenile verses, entitled
<i>Poems By Two Brothers</i>. <i>On Sublimity</i> contains eleven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
stanzas of ten lines each. The poet disdains "vales in tenderest
green," and asks for "the wild cascade, the rugged
scene," the sea, the mountains, dark cathedrals, storms,
"Niagara's flood of matchless might," and Mammoth
Cave.</p>

<p>Tennyson was the third and last English poet of the
nineteenth century to make mention of Kentucky in his
works.</p>

<p>Much writing has been done by Kentuckians from the
beginning until the present time, but most of what is
usually termed literature is the work of the school of today.
That much, however, of the early productions, especially
the anonymous and fugitive poems, have been
forever lost, may be gathered from a letter written to Edwin
Bryant, editor of <i>The Lexington Intelligencer</i>, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
an Ohio correspondent, which appeared in that paper in
January, 1834, a part of which is as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>There were a vast number of rural and sentimental songs, sung
by the hunters and pioneers, that, in this our day, to the present
generation would be truly interesting. Would it not be wise for
you, Messrs. Editors, to publish a note in your valuable paper,
offering the "Poets' Corner," and save what you can of the fragments
of "Olden Times?"... I know that there were many
sentimental pieces&mdash;some written by a Mr. Bullock&mdash;many war
songs; one on St. Clair's defeat; and there was a wonderful flow
of poetical effusions on the first discovery of a settlement of Kentucky.
There was a wooing song of the hunter&mdash;one stanza I
can only repeat:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I will plough and live, and you may knit and sowe,<br /></span>
<span class="i05">And through the wild woods, I'll hunt the buffaloe!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To many these things may appear as ... light as empty
air, but look to the future, and you will at once discover the inquisitive
mind will earnestly desire to look into such matters and
things.</p></blockquote>

<p>The pity is, this admonition passed unheeded by Bryant
and his contemporaries, and much that "the inquisitive
mind" would revel in to-day, was thus lost. The most
famous, however, of the pioneer songs that the above
quoted writer probably had in mind, <i>The Hunters of Kentucky</i>,
the celebrated ballad of the Battle of New Orleans,
has come down to us, but it was written by the alien hand
of Samuel Woodworth, who achieved a double triumph
over oblivion by also writing <i>The Old Oaken Bucket</i>. And
were other "wooing songs of the hunter" extant, we
would certainly discover that many of them were done
by non-Kentuckians. Even <i>Kentucky Belle</i>, ballad of
Morgan and his men, was the work of Constance Fenimore
Woolson, the famous author of <i>Anne</i>.</p>

<p>In recent years the ballads of the Kentucky mountains
have been investigated by a group of scholars, and Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
Hubert Gibson Shearin will shortly publish a collection
of them. It is impossible to discuss them at this time;
and as nearly all of them are offshoots of the old English
ballads and Scottish songs, done over by their Kentucky
descendants, the ever-recurring question: "Are they
Kentucky productions?" will not down.</p>


<p class="center">II</p>

<p class="center">THE KENTUCKY MAGAZINES</p>

<p>Kentucky has failed to produce and maintain a respectable
literary magazine for any considerable length of
time. Many magazines have been born in Kentucky with
high hopes, and a few of them have braved the storms
for a number of years, but all of them have gone the way
of all the earth after a pathetic struggle for existence.</p>

<p>The reasons for this lie not far afield: the leading
magazines and periodicals of the east through the immensity
of their circulation secure that large patronage
necessary to maintain a publication conducted on a
generous basis, ensuring variety and excellence. Experience
has long since demonstrated even to the bravest
of the inland publishers that the point of distribution is
the controlling factor in success. The means of transportation
which have so miraculously improved, have annihilated
distance and along with it to no small extent
the Western and Southern periodical of literary flavor.
The opulent publications are enabled through their very
prosperity to command contributors not to be approached
by a periodical circumscribed in means and constituency.
Again, the Kentucky magazines have all along made the
fatal mistake of truckling to dead prejudices and sectionalism.
The material and the moulders have long been
with us, but the wide popular support, which after all is
the first essential, has failed to materialise, and it may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
be regretfully apprehended that it now lies as far away
as ever.</p>

<p>The first magazine issued in Kentucky or the West was
<i>The Medley, or Monthly Miscellany, for the year 1803</i>,
which was edited and published by Daniel Bradford, son
of old John Bradford, the editor of <i>The Kentucky
Gazette</i>. <i>The Medley</i> lived through the year of 1803,
but in January, 1804, Editor Bradford announced that
he was compelled, from lack of appreciation, to abandon
its publication. The twelve parts were bound for those
of the subscribers who cared to have them made into a
single volume, and probably not more than two copies are
extant to-day. <i>The Medley's</i> literary merit was not impressive,
and its death can only be deplored because it
happened to be the first Western magazine.</p>

<p><i>The Almoner</i>, a religious periodical, the first issue of
which was dated from Lexington, April, 1814, and which
died a twelvemonth later, was published by Thomas T.
Skillman, the pioneer printer. Its account of the
preacher, John Poage Campbell, and his many theological
works, is about all one finds of interest in it.</p>

<p>William Gibbes Hunt, a Harvard man, who later took
a degree from Transylvania University, established <i>The
Western Review</i> at Lexington, in August, 1819, and this
was the first literary magazine in the West worthy the
name. Hunt was a man of fine tastes, and he had a
proper conception of what a magazine should be. He
worked hard for two years, but in July, 1821,&mdash;the number
for which month is notable as having contained the
first draft of General William O. Butler's famous poem,
<i>The Boatman's Horn</i>, which is there entitled <i>The Boat
Horn</i>,&mdash;Hunt rehearsed the pathetic tale of the lack of
support and appreciation for a Western magazine, and,
without any expressed regret, entitled it his valedictory.
He had survived twice as long as any of his predecessors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
and he probably felt that he had done fairly well, as he
undoubtedly had. The four bound volumes of <i>The
Western Review</i> may be read to-day with more than an
historical interest. Hunt returned to his home in New
England; and the only other thing of his that is preserved
is <i>An Address on the Principles of Masonry</i>
(Lexington, 1821), and a very excellent oration it is, too.</p>

<p>There were brave men after Hunt, however. <i>The
Literary Pamphleteer</i> was born and died at Paris, Kentucky,
in 1823; and in the following year Thomas T. Skillman
established <i>The Western Luminary</i> at Lexington.
This was a semi-religious journal, but its publication was
shortly suspended. <i>The Microscope</i> seems to have been
the first magazine published at Louisville, it being
founded in 1824, but its life was ephemeral. Under a
half a dozen different names, with many lapses between
the miles, <i>The Transylvanian</i>, which Professor Thomas
Johnson Matthews, of Transylvania University, established
at Lexington in 1829, has survived until the present
time. It is now the literary magazine of Transylvania
University. Mr. James Lane Allen, Mr. Frank
Waller Allen, and one or two other well-known Kentucky
writers saw their earliest essays and stories first published
in <i>The Transylvanian</i>. John Clark's <i>Lexington
Literary Journal</i>, a twice-a-week affair, was founded in
1833; and the <i>Louisville Literary News-Letter</i>, edited by
Edmund Flagg and issued by George D. Prentice, lived in
the Kentucky metropolis from December, 1838, to November,
1840.</p>

<p>Far and away the most famous literary periodical ever
published in Kentucky, was <i>The Western Messenger</i>,
founded at Cincinnati in 1835, and removed to Louisville
in April, 1836. James Freeman Clarke (1810-1888), the
noted Boston Unitarian preacher and author, was editor,
publisher, and agent of <i>The Messenger</i> while it was at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>
Louisville; and he solicited subscriptions throughout
Kentucky. Ralph Waldo Emerson first appeared as a
poet in his friend Clarke's magazine. His <i>Goodby
Proud World</i>, <i>The Rhodora</i>, <i>The Humble Bee</i>, and several
of his other now noted poems, were printed for the
first time in <i>The Messenger</i>. Clarke also published
papers from the hands of Hawthorne, Oliver Wendell
Holmes, William Ellery Channing, Margaret Fuller, and
nearly all of the writers now grouped as the New England
school. He printed a poem of John Keats, which
had never been previously published, the manuscript of
which was furnished by George Keats, brother of the
poet, who lived at Louisville for many years. Clarke
later wrote an interesting sketch of George Keats for his
magazine. During parts of the four years he published
<i>The Messenger</i> at Louisville he had as assistant editors
Christopher P. Cranch and Samuel Osgood, now
well-known names in American letters. Clarke returned
to Boston in 1840, and <i>The Messenger</i> returned to Cincinnati,
where it was suspended in April, 1841. "The
periodical was an exotic," wrote William Henry Venable,
"a Boston flower blooming in the Ohio Valley;" and this
is the one-line history of it. Its like was never seen before,
never since, and will never be seen again in the West.</p>

<p>Thirteen years after <i>The Western Messenger</i> left
Louisville, <i>The Western Literary Magazine</i>, a monthly
publication, was begun; and three years later, or in 1856,
<i>The Louisville Review</i>, another monthly, was established.
But the war clouds of civil strife were gradually gathering,
and the endless pen scratching of the Kentucky
magazinist was lost in the cannon's roar. Newspapers
were the only things Kentuckians had time to peruse.</p>

<p>Since the war Kentucky periodicals have been, almost
without exception, rather tame affairs. They have all
been most mushroomish. A few of them may be singled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>
out, such as <i>The Southern Bivouac</i>, which was conducted
at Louisville for several years by General Basil W. Duke
and Richard W. Knott; <i>The Illustrated Kentuckian</i>,
founded at Lexington, in 1892; <i>The Southern Magazine</i>,
of Louisville, published papers by Mr. Allen, stories by
Mr. John Fox, Jr., and several other now well-known
writers; and Charles J. O'Malley's <i>Midland Review</i> ran
for some time. These are the comparatively recent Kentucky
periodicals which have bloomed in a day and wilted
with the earliest winter. <i>The Register</i>, official organ of
the State Historical Society, is still being issued three
times a year. It is unique among Kentucky magazines in
that it is the only one that has had adequate financial support,
which, however, comes to it in the form of a State
appropriation. For the last twenty-five years <i>The Courier-Journal</i>,
of Louisville, has devoted space in its Saturday
edition to reviews of new books; and in recent years
<i>The Evening Post</i>, also of Louisville, has maintained a
similar department.</p>

<h2><a name="ACKNOWLEDGMENTS" id="ACKNOWLEDGMENTS">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</a></h2>


<p>The last several years have been devoted to the collecting
and classifying of Kentucky books and authors from
Filson, in 1784, to Mr. Allen, in 1912. While the author
has done other things, this has been his most serious
business.</p>

<p>Of the more than a thousand Kentucky writers, one
hundred and ninety-six, or those who achieved considerable
reputation in their day and generation, or others
to whom fame came late, are now discussed. The author
hopes to publish within the next two or three years a
<i>Dictionary of Kentucky Writers</i>, which will attempt to
bring together in brief biographical and critical notes all
of Kentucky's literary workers from the beginning until
the present time. The crossroads poet is a most elusive,
most diffident figure, but I shall do my best to bring him
into the <i>Dictionary</i> that is to be.</p>

<p>I have received assistance from many quarters. Colonel
Reuben T. Durrett, Dr. Henry A. Cottell, General
Bennett H. Young, Colonel Robert M. Kelly, Mrs. Evelyn
Snead Barnett, Mrs. Elvira Miller Slaughter, and Mr.
George T. Settle, of Louisville, Kentucky, have aided me
in many directions. Mr. George McCalla Spears, of
Dallas, Texas, author of <i>Dear Old Kentucky</i>, and the
owner of one of the best collections of Kentucky books ever
gotten together, I have to thank for a catalogue of his
library and a dozen informing letters. Judge James H.
Mulligan, Miss Anna Totten, Mrs. Annie Gratz Clay, Miss
Jo Peter, and Mr. James M. Roach, of Lexington, Kentucky,
have loaned and given me many rare Kentucky
items; to Mr. William Kavanaugh Doty, of Richmond,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>
Kentucky, Mrs. Daniel Henry Holmes, of Covington, Kentucky,
Mrs. Lucien Beckner, of Winchester, Kentucky,
Dr. Thomas E. Pickett, of Maysville, Kentucky, State
Librarian Frank K. Kavanaugh, of Frankfort, Kentucky,
Mr. Alexander Hill, and Miss Marian Prentice Piatt, of
Cincinnati, Ohio, Mr. Henry Cleveland Wood, of Harrodsburg,
Kentucky, Mr. Paul Weir, of Owensboro, Kentucky,
Mr. Ingram Crockett, of Henderson, Kentucky,
Mrs. Mary Addams Bayne, of Shelbyville, Kentucky, Miss
Leigh Gordon Giltner, of Eminence, Kentucky, and Mrs.
Caroline S. Valentine, of New Castle, Kentucky, the
majority of whom are writers, I am doubly indebted for
facts regarding their own work, as well as for what I now
more especially thank them&mdash;information concerning
other Kentucky writers.</p>

<p>Death found the two best friends, perhaps, this work
had during the course of its preparation, when it took
Charles J. O'Malley, the Kentucky poet and critic, and
Jahu Dewitt Miller, the Philadelphia lecturer and bookman.
Both of these men had just gotten into the spirit
of the work when they died within a year of each other.
O'Malley wrote the most illuminating letters concerning
Kentucky authors it has been my good fortune to receive;
Miller made the most gratifying and surprising
additions to my collection of Kentuckiana, exceedingly
scarce volumes and pamphlets which he alone seemed
able to unearth from the old bookshops of the country.
The memories of them both must be ever green with me
and in this work.</p>

<p>I have to thank Mr. Allen for his very fine introduction.
To have one's name associated with his is reward sufficient
for the years of toil and sacrifice this work has demanded
of its author.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="JOHN_FILSON" id="JOHN_FILSON">JOHN FILSON</a></h2>


<p>John Filson, the first Kentucky historian, was born at
East Fallowfield, Pennsylvania, in 1747. He was educated
at the academy of the Rev. Samuel Finley, at Nottingham,
Maryland. Finley was afterwards president of
Princeton University. John Filson looked askance at the
Revolutionary War, and came out to Kentucky about
1783. In Lexington he conducted a school for a year, and
spent his leisure hours in collecting data for a history of
Kentucky. He interviewed Daniel Boone, Levi Todd,
James Harrod, and many other Kentucky pioneers; and
the information they gave him was united with his own
observations, forming the material for his book. Filson
did not remain in Kentucky much over a year for, in 1784,
he went to Wilmington, Delaware, and persuaded James
Adams, the town's chief printer, to issue his manuscript
as <i>The Discovery, Settlement, and Present State of Kentucke</i>;
and then he continued his journey to Philadelphia,
where his map of the three original counties of Kentucky&mdash;Jefferson,
Fayette, and Lincoln&mdash;was printed and dedicated
to General Washington and the United States Congress.
This Wilmington edition of Filson's history is far
and away the most famous history of Kentucky ever published.
Though it contained but 118 pages, one of the six
extant copies recently fetched the fabulous sum of $1,250&mdash;the
highest price ever paid for a Kentucky book. The
little work was divided into two parts, the first part being
devoted to the history of the country, and the second part
was the first biography of Daniel Boone ever published.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
Boone dictated this famous story of his life to the Pennsylvania
pedagogue, who put it into shape for publication,
yet several Western writers refer to it as "Boone's autobiography."
Boone is the author's central hero straight
through the work, and he is happier when discussing him
than in relating the country's meager history. Filson's
<i>Kentucky</i> was translated into French by M. Parraud, and
issued at Paris in 1785; and in the same year a German
version was published. Gilbert Imlay incorporated it
into the several editions of his <i>Topographical Description
of the Western Territory of North America</i> (London,
1793). And several subsequent Western writers also reproduced
it in their works, seldom giving Filson the
proper credit for it. The last three or four years of his
life John Filson spent in Kentucky, Illinois, and Indiana.
He was one of the founders of Cincinnati, which he named
"Losantiville;" and a short time later, in 1788, he wandered
into the Miami woods one day and was never seen
again. Col. Reuben T. Durrett, the Louisville historian,
wrote his biography, and established an historical organization,
in 1884, which he named the "Filson Club." Filson's
fame is secure in Kentucky, and Colonel Durrett
and his work have made it so.</p>

settled parts of America. In summer it has not the sandy heats
which Virginia and Carolina experience, and receives a fine air
from its rivers. In winter, which at most lasts three months,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
commonly two, and is but seldom severe, the people are safe in bad
houses; and the beasts have a goodly supply without fodder. The
winter begins about Christmas, and ends about the first of March,
at farthest does not exceed the middle of that month. Snow
seldom falls deep or lies long. The west winds often bring storms
and the east winds clear the sky; but there is no steady rule of
weather in that respect, as in the northern states. The west
winds are sometimes cold and nitrous. The Ohio running in that
direction, and there being mountains on that quarter, the westerly
winds, by sweeping along their tops, in the cold regions of the
air, and over a long tract of frozen water, collect cold in their
course, and convey it over the Kentucky country; but the weather
is not so intensely severe as these winds bring with them in Pennsylvania.
The air and seasons depend very much on the winds
as to heat and cold, dryness and moisture.</p>

<p>Among the native animals are the urus, bison, or zorax, described
by Cesar, which we call a buffalo, much resembling a large
bull, of a great size, with a large head, thick, short, crooked horns,
and broader in his forepart than behind. Upon his shoulder is a
large lump of flesh, covered with a thick boss of long wool and
curly hair, of a dark brown color. They do not rise from the
ground as our cattle, but spring up at once upon their feet; are
of a broad make, and clumsy appearance, with short legs, but run
fast, and turn not aside for any thing when chased, except a
standing tree. They weigh from 500 to 1000 weight, are excellent
meat, supplying the inhabitants in many parts with beef, and
their hides make good leather. I have heard a hunter assert, he
saw above 1000 buffaloes at the Blue Licks at once; so numerous
were they before the first settlers had wantonly sported away
their lives. There still remains a great number in the exterior
parts of the settlement. They feed upon cane and grass, as
other cattle, and are innocent, harmless creatures.</p>

<p>There are still to be found many deer, elks, and bears, within
the settlement, and many more on the borders of it. There are
also panthers, wild cats, and wolves.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>The waters have plenty of beavers, otters, minks, and muskrats:
nor are the animals common to other parts wanting, such
as foxes, rabbits, squirrels, racoons, ground-hogs, pole-cats, and
opossums. Most of the species of the domestic quadrupeds have
been introduced since the settlement, such as horses, cows, sheep,
and hogs, which are prodigiously multiplied, suffered to run in
the woods without a keeper, and only brought home when wanted.</p>


<p class="center">BOONE'S FIRST VIEW OF KENTUCKY</p>

<p class="center">[From the same]</p>

<p>It was on the 1st of May, in the year 1769, that I resigned my
domestic happiness for a time, and left my family and peaceable
habitation on the Yadkin river, in North Carolina, to wander
through the wilderness of America, in quest of the country of
Kentucky, in company with John Finley, John Stewart, Joseph
Holden, James Monay, and William Cool. We proceeded successfully;
and after a long and fatiguing journey, through a mountainous
wilderness, in a westward direction, on the seventh day
of June following we found ourselves on Red river, where John
Finley had formerly been trading with the Indians, and, from
the top of an eminence, saw with pleasure the beautiful level
of Kentucky. Here let me observe, that for some time we had
experienced the most uncomfortable weather as a prelibation of
our future sufferings. At this place we encamped, and made a
shelter to defend us from the inclement season, and began to hunt
and reconnoiter the country. We found everywhere abundance
of wild beasts of all sorts, through this vast forest. The buffaloe
were more frequent than I have seen cattle in the settlements,
browsing on the leaves of the cane, or cropping the herbage on
those extensive plains, fearless, because ignorant, of the violence
of man. Sometimes we saw hundreds in a drove, and the numbers
about the salt springs were amazing. In this forest, the
habitation of beasts of every kind natural to America, we practiced
hunting with great success, until the 22d day of December
following.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="JOHN_BRADFORD" id="JOHN_BRADFORD">JOHN BRADFORD</a></h2>


<p>John Bradford, Kentucky's pioneer journalist, was born
near Warrenton, Virginia, in 1749. He saw service in
the Revolutionary War, and came to Kentucky when
thirty years of age. He fought against the Indians at
Chillicothe, and, in 1785, brought his family out from Virginia
to Kentucky, locating at Cane Run, near Lexington.
Two years later he and his brother, Fielding Bradford,
founded <i>The Kentucke Gazette</i>, the first issue of which
appeared Saturday, August 18, 1787&mdash;the second newspaper
west of the Alleghanies. The following year John
Bradford published <i>The Kentucke Almanac</i>, the first
pamphlet from a Western press; and this almanac was issued
every twelvemonth for many years. Fielding Bradford
withdrew from the <i>Gazette</i> in May, 1788, and "Old
Jawn," as he was called, carried the entire burden until
1802, when his son, Daniel Bradford, assumed control.
In March, 1789, under instructions from the Virginia
legislature, Bradford discarded "Kentucke" for "Kentucky,"
one of the many interesting facts connected with
the <i>Gazette</i>. John Bradford was the first state printer;
and the first book he published was the laws passed by the
first Kentucky legislature, which assembled at Lexington
in 1792. The Bradfords published many of the most important
early Western books, and a "Bradford" brings
joy to the heart of any present-day collector of Kentuckiana.
The column in the <i>Gazette</i> devoted to verse, headed
"Sacred to the Muses," preserved many early Western
poems; but the little anecdotes which seldom failed to be
tucked beneath the verse, were nearly always coarse and
vulgar, giving one a rather excellent index to the editor's
morals or the morals of his readers. Bradford appears
to have taken a great fancy to the poems of Philip Freneau
(1752-1832), the first real American poet, for he
"picked up" more than twenty of them from the <i>Freeman's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Journal</i>. The most complete files of the <i>Kentucky
Gazette</i> are preserved in the Lexington Public Library,
though the vandals that have consulted them from time to
time have cut and inked out many valuable things. John
Bradford was a public-spirited citizen, being, at different
times, chairman of the town trustees, and of the board of
trustees of Transylvania University. He was a profound
mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher, his contemporaries
tell us, and in proof thereof they have handed
down another of his sobriquets, "Old Wisdom." Though
his fame as the first Kentucky editor is fixed, as an author
his reputation rests upon <i>The General Instructor; or, the
Office, Duty, and Authority of Justices of the Peace, Sheriffs,
Coroners, and Constables, in the State of Kentucky</i>
(Lexington, Ky., 1800), a legal compilation; and upon his
more famous work, <i>Notes on Kentucky</i> (Xenia, Ohio,
1827). These sixty-two articles were originally printed
in the <i>Gazette</i> between August 25, 1826, and January 9,
1829. Upon this work John Bradford is ranked among
the Kentucky historians. At the time of his death, which
occurred at Lexington, Kentucky, March 31, 1830, he was
sheriff of Fayette county.</p>

<p>This country was well known to the Indian traders many years
before its settlement. They gave a description of it to Lewis
Evans, who published his first map of it as early as 1752.</p>

Powell and several others from the counties of Orange and Culpepper,
in the state of Virginia, set out on an excursion to the
Western Waters; they traveled down the Holstein river, and
crossed over the Mountains into Powell's valley, thence across
the Cumberland mountain at the gap where the road now crosses,
proceeded on across what was formerly known by the name of
the Wilderness until they arrived at the Hazlepath; here the
company divided, Dr. Walker with a part continued north until
they came to the Kentucky river which they named Louisa or
Levisa river. After traveling down the excessive broken or hilly
margin some distance they became dissatisfied and returned and
continued up one of its branches to its head, and crossed over
the mountains to New River at the place called Walker's Meadows.</p>

<p>In the year 1754 James McBride with some others, passed down
the Ohio river in canoes, and landed at the mouth of the Kentucky
river, where they marked on a tree the initials of their
names, and the date of the year. These men passed through the
country and were the first who gave a particular account of its
beauty and richness of soil to the inhabitants of the British settlements
in America.</p>

<p>No further notice seems to have been taken of Kentucky until
the year 1767, when John Finlay with others (whilst trading
with the Indians) passed through a part of the rich lands of Kentucky.
It was then called by the Indians in their language, the
Dark and Bloody Grounds. Some difference took place between
these traders and the Indians, and Finlay deemed it prudent to
return to his residence in North Carolina, where he communicated
his knowledge of the country to Col. Daniel Boone and others.
This seems to have been one of the most important events in the
history of Kentucky, as it was the exciting cause which prompted
Col. Boone shortly afterwards to make his first visit to the Dark
and Bloody Grounds.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="MATTHEW_LYON" id="MATTHEW_LYON">MATTHEW LYON</a></h2>


<p>Matthew Lyon, "the Hampden of Congress," was born in
County Wicklow, Ireland, July 14, 1750. He emigrated
to America when he was fifteen years old, and settled in
Woodbury, Connecticut, as an apprentice of Jabez Bacon,
the wealthiest merchant in all New England. Lyon left
Connecticut, in 1774, and removed to Vermont, where he
became one of the famous Green Mountain Boys of the
Revolution. He was a member of the Vermont legislature
for four years; and in 1783 he founded the town of Fair
Haven, Vermont. Lyon became one of the great men of
Vermont, a disciple of Thomas Jefferson, "the pioneer
Democrat of New England." In 1796 he was elected to
Congress and he went to Philadelphia in May, 1797, to enter
upon his duties. He at once became one of the powerful
men in that body. Lyon had published a newspaper at
Fair Haven for several years, besides issuing a number of
books from his press, but during the years of 1798 and
1799 he edited the now famous <i>Scourge of Aristocracy</i>, a
semi-monthly magazine. At the present day this is a rare
volume, and much to be desired. In 1801 Lyon cast Vermont's
vote for Thomas Jefferson against Aaron Burr
for the presidency, and this vote is said to have made certain
Jefferson's election. Late in this year of 1801 Lyon
left Vermont for Kentucky, and he later became the
founder of Eddyville, Lyon county, Kentucky. The county,
however, was named in honor of his son, Chittenden
Lyon. In 1802 Matthew Lyon was a member of the Kentucky
legislature; and from 1803 to 1811 he was in the
lower House of Congress from his Kentucky district.
His opposition to the War of 1812 retired him to private
life. At Eddyville he was engaged in shipbuilding, in
which he had great success, but after his defeat for relection
to Congress, in 1812, disasters came fast upon
him, and he was reduced from affluence to comparative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
poverty. At the age of sixty-eight years, however,
he recovered himself, paid all his debts, and died in easy
circumstances. In 1820 Lyon was appointed United
States Factor to the Cherokee Indians of Arkansas territory,
and he set out for his future home at Spadra Bluff,
Arkansas. He was later elected as Arkansas's second
delegate to Congress, but he did not live to take his seat,
dying at Spadra Bluff, August 1, 1822. Eleven years
later his remains were returned to Kentucky, and re-interred
at Eddyville, where a proper monument marks
the spot to-day. Matthew Lyon's reply to John Randolph
of Roanoke, in 1804, in regard to the old question of the
Yazoo frauds, is his only extant speech that is at all remembered
at the present time.</p>

<p>The Postmaster General [Gideon Granger] has not lost my
esteem, nor do I think his character can be injured by the braying
of a jackal, or the fulminations of a madman. But, sir, permit
me to inquire from whom these charges of bribery, of corruption,
and of robbery, come? Is it from one who has for forty years, in
one shape or other, been intrusted with the property and concerns
of other people, and has never wanted for confidence, one whose
long and steady practice of industry, integrity, and well doing,
has obtained for him his standing on this floor? Is it from one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
who sneered with contempt on the importunity with which he has
solicited to set a price on the important vote he held in the last
Presidential election? No, sir, these charges have been fabricated
in the disordered imagination of a young man whose pride has
been provoked by my refusing to sing encores to all his political
dogmas. I have had the impudence to differ from him in some
few points, and some few times to neglect his fiat. It is long
since I have observed that the very sight of my plebeian face has
had an unpleasant effect on the gentleman's nose, for out of respect
to this House and to the State he represents, I will yet
occasionally call him gentleman. I say, sir, these charges have
been brought against me by a person nursed in the bosom of
opulence, inheriting the life services of a numerous train of the
human species, and extensive fields, the original proprietors of
which property, in all probability, came no honester by it than
the purchasers of the Georgia lands did by what they claim. Let
that gentleman apply the fable of the thief and the receiver, in
Dilworth's Spelling Book, so ingeniously quoted by himself, in
his own case, and give up the stolen men in his possession. I
say, sir, these charges have come from a person whose fortune,
leisure and genius have enabled him to obtain a great share of the
wisdom of the schools, but who in years, experience, and the
knowledge of the world and the ways of man, is many, many years
behind those he implicates&mdash;a person who, from his rant in this
House, seems to have got his head as full of British contracts and
British modes of corruption as ever Don Quixote's was supposed
to have been of chivalry, enchantments and knight errantry&mdash;a
person who seems to think no man can be honest and independent
unless he has inherited land and negroes, nor is he willing to
allow a man to vote in the people's elections unless he is a landholder.</p>

<p>I can tell that gentleman I am as far from offering or receiving
a bribe as he or any other member on this floor; it is a charge
which no man ever made against me before him, who from his
insulated situation, unconversant with the world, is perhaps as
little acquainted with my character as any member of this House,
or almost any man in the nation, and I do most cordially believe
that, had my back and my mind been supple enough to rise and
fall with his motions, I should have escaped his censure.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>I, sir, have none of that pride which sets men above being merchants
and dealers; the calling of a merchant is, in my opinion,
equally dignified, and no more than equally dignified with that
of a farmer, or a manufacturer. I have a great part of my life
been engaged in all the stations of merchant, farmer and manufacturer,
in which I have honestly earned and lost a great deal
of property, in the character of a merchant. I act like other
merchants, look out for customers with whom I can make bargains
advantageous to both parties; it is all the same to me
whether I contract with an individual or the public; I see no constitutional
impediment to a member of this House serving the
public for the same reward the public gives another. Whenever
my constituents or myself think I have contracts inconsistent
with my duties as a member of this House, I will retire from it.</p>

<p>I came to this House as a representative of a free, a brave, and
a generous people. I thank my Creator that He gave me the face
of a man, not that of an ape or a monkey, and that He gave me the
heart of a man also, a heart which will spare to its last drop in
defence of the dignity of the station my generous constituents
have placed me in. I shall trouble the House no farther at this
time, than by observing that I shall not be deterred by the threats
of the member from Virginia from giving the vote I think the
interest and honor of the nation require; and by saying if that
member means to be understood that I have offered contracts from
the Postmaster-General, the assertion or insinuation has no foundation
in truth, and I challenge him to bring forward his boasted
proof.</p>

<h2><a name="GILBERT_IMLAY" id="GILBERT_IMLAY">GILBERT IMLAY</a></h2>


<p>Gilbert Imlay, the first Kentucky novelist, was born in
New Jersey, about 1755. He was captain of a company
in the Revolution. The war over, Imlay turned his face
toward the West; and he reached the Falls of the Ohio&mdash;Louisville&mdash;in
1784. In the little river town he worked
under George May as a "commissioner for laying out
lands in the back settlements." Imlay had not been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
Kentuckian many months before he had obtained patents
for many thousand acres of land&mdash;all of which he subsequently
lost. It is not certainly known how long he remained
in Kentucky, but it was about eight years. He
went to London in 1792 and, in that year, the first edition
of his <i>Topographical Description of the Western Territory
of North America</i> was published. This work is made
up of a series of descriptive letters which the author wrote
from Kentucky to an English friend. The second edition
of 1793, and the third edition of 1797, reproduced John
Filson's <i>Kentucke</i> and Thomas Hutchins's <i>History</i>, together
with much new material. While a resident of Kentucky
Gilbert Imlay wrote the first Kentucky novel, entitled
<i>The Emigrants, or the History of an Expatriated
Family, being a Delineation of English Manners drawn
from Real Characters. Written in America, by G. Imlay,
Esq.</i> (London, 1793, 3 vols.; Dublin, 1794, 1 vol.). The
epistolary form is adopted throughout, and the narrative
relates the fortunes of "an eminent merchant in the city
of London," Mr. T&mdash;&mdash;n, who loses his great fortune and
emigrates with his family to America. His daughter, the
beautiful Caroline, is the heroine of the story. Landing
in Philadelphia, they travel to Pittsburgh, and from there
drift down the Ohio river in a Kentucky flatboat, or
"ark," to Louisville. Caroline's lover, Capt Arl&mdash;&mdash;ton,
had preceded the family and gone on to Lexington, but he
soon returned to Louisville when he learned that his
sweetheart awaited his coming. "The emigrants" remained
in Kentucky some three months, or from June
until August. Caroline's capture by the Indians in August
decided the family to forsake the "dark and bloody
ground," though she was safely rescued. They finally
find their way to London, and all ends well. <i>The Emigrants</i>,
in the three-volume edition, is exceedingly scarce,
but the Dublin one-volume edition may be occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
procured in the rare book shops of London. In 1793 Gilbert
Imlay went to Paris, where he met the famous Mary
Wollstonecraft, with whom he was soon living, as they
both held mutual affection equivalent to marriage. In
1794 a daughter was born to them, Fanny Imlay, who committed
suicide at Swansea, October 10, 1816. In April,
1796, Imlay and Mary agreed to go separate paths after
much stormy weather together; and a short time later she
became the wife of William Godwin, the English philosopher
and novelist. In giving birth to the future wife of
the poet Shelley, she surrendered her own life. Mary
Wollstonecraft's <i>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</i>
is the chief memorial of her pathetic and eventful career.
After having parted on that April morning of 1796 with
the woman he had so outrageously treated, Gilbert Imlay,
"the handsome scoundrel," is lost to history. When,
where, or how he died is unknown.</p>

<p>It is impossible for me to see Caroline in the present state of my
mind, and therefore I hope you will not look upon it in the least
disrespectful, my friend, if I should happen to be absent when
you arrive; for to be candid with you, I shall make a journey
purposely to Lexington.</p>

<p>Your obliging favour from Pittsburg, which you meant should
give me spirits, has had quite a contrary effect.</p>

<p>The image you have given of Caroline makes her appear to me
more lovely than ever; and when you say that enchantment seems
to spring up where e'er she treads, I feel the full force of all her
charms, and conceive that I behold her in this season of fragrance
and beauty, decorating those gardens which you passed through
on your return from the fatal view upon the Allegany,</p>

<p>She is irresistible&mdash;and it is only by absence that I shall ever
be enabled to forget my misfortunes, and therefore, my dear
friend, I must request that in your future letters, when you mention
that divine woman, you will not appreciate that beauty
which has ten thousand charms to fascinate and fetter the soul.</p>

<p>She has not only all the symmetry of form, the softness of love,
and the enchantment of a goddess; but she can assume an animation
and that surprising activity of motion, that while you are
suspended in the transports of astonishment, you are lost in admiration
at the gracefulness with which she moves&mdash;I have seen
her bound over a rock, and pluck a wild honey-suckle, that grew
upon the side of a precipice, and while I stood gazing at her in
amazement, she has brought it as a trophy of her exertions.</p>

<p>Believe, my friend, that if ever nature formed one woman to
excel another in personal charms, it must be Caroline.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I leave this enclosed in a packet for General W&mdash;&mdash;. I am
this moment informed there are boats making round Diamond
Island. Who knows but one of them contains the lovely Caroline?
Ah! my friend, I feel every emotion of love and shame so powerfully,
that I must instantly fly to avoid exposing myself&mdash;curse
that mandate which banished me from the lovely tyrant of my
heart&mdash;curse the vanity which exposed my weakness;&mdash;for
damnable is that fate which compels a man to avoid the object
of all others, which to him is the most interesting&mdash;I must this
instant be off. O Caroline!&mdash;Caroline! while my soul deadens
at the thought, I abandon the spot which will be converted into
elysium the moment you arrive. Forgive me, my friend, this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
effusion of nature&mdash;this weakness, for it prepares us for those
delicious raptures, that flow from the source of sympathy, and
while it softens us to that tender texture, which is congenial to
feminine charms, it invigorates our actions, and fosters every
generous and noble sentiment.</p>

<p>The streamers of your vessels, for it must be you, are playing
in the wind, as if enraptured with the treasure over which they
impend, seem eradiated with the charms of Caroline; while the
gentle Ohio, as if conscious of its charge, proudly swells, and
appears to vie with the more elevated earth, in order to secure to
its divinity, upon which to tread at her disembarkation, the flowery

<p>My dear James,</p>

<p>From the time we left Pittsburg until our arrival here, which
was ten days after our embarkation, we were all appreciating the
pleasure we should derive from finding you at this place.</p>

<p>I had expatiated largely upon the satisfaction we should experience
from the information you would give us of the country;
and no sooner were we in sight of the town that we hung out a
flag of invitation; not doubting that you would observe it, and
immediately come off to us in a barge; but what was the surprise
of the whole part, and my mortification, when we learned upon
landing, you had left the place not more than half an hour.</p>

<p>The letter you left enclosed for me in General W&mdash;&mdash;'s packet,
to be sure, informed me of the cause of your absence; but it by
no means justified the action. And I demand as a proof of your
respect for your old friends, that you instantly return.</p>

<p>Remember, James, this is the command of a friend, who is
anxious to restore you to a state of reason, which it appears you
have not possessed for some time past.</p>

<p>Caroline was in tolerable spirits until within two days of our
arrival, when she suddenly appeared to be pensive and in a state
of extreme trepidation; and since we arrived she has been confined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
by indisposition.</p>

<p>If you have a delicate and tender regard for this charming
girl, you will fly immediately to enquire after her health. But
to put it out of your power to frame a shadow for an excuse, I
inform you that it is my intention first to visit the Illinois, and
to view this country on my return.</p>

<p>I waited during yesterday for an opportunity to send this,
and as I could not meet with one, I send a person I have hired
for that purpose, as my men are unacquainted with the country.</p>

<p>Believe me to be your sincere, but unhappy friend,</p>

<h2><a name="ADAM_RANKIN" id="ADAM_RANKIN">ADAM RANKIN</a></h2>


<p>Rev. Adam Rankin, author of the first book ever printed
in Kentucky, was born in Pennsylvania, March 24, 1755.
He was graduated from Liberty Hall, now Washington
and Lee University, Lexington, Virginia, when about
twenty-five years of age; and two years later he was licensed
to preach by the Virginia Presbytery. Rev. Rankin
came to Lexington, Kentucky, in 1784, to accept the
pastorate of the Presbyterian church. He also conducted
a school for some time, but his one thought was Psalmody,
which became "his monomania." He created a schism
in his church by insisting that Dr. Watts's imitation of
the Psalms of David be expelled from the church worship,
and that the Psalms in their most literal dress be chanted.
His brethren disapproved of his views, but they could not
discourage him or cause him to discard his contention.
Everywhere he went he preached and wrote upon his favorite
subject. Rev. Rankin's Kentucky brethren made
life unbearable for him, and he went to London, where he
remained for two years. When he did return to Kentucky
it was to face accusation after accusation, and
church trial after church trial, until he was finally suspended.
Rev. Rankin was a strange, eccentric man, a
dreamer of dreams, a Kentucky Luther, and, perhaps, a
bit crazed with the bitter opposition his views received.
His latest, boldest dream was that Jerusalem was about
to be rebuilt and that he must hurry there in order to assist
in the rebuilding. He bade his Lexington flock farewell,
and started to the Holy City, but, on November 25,
1827, death overtook him at Philadelphia. Rev. Rankin
was the author of several theological works, but his <i>A
Process in the Transylvania Presbytery, &amp;c.</i> (Maxwell
and Gooch, At the Sign of the Buffalo, Main Street, Lexington,
1793), is the first book ever printed in Kentucky,
if the <i>Kentucky Acts</i> which John Bradford published in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the same year be excepted. Many days were required to
print this little book of Rankin upon the hand-press of
the publishers, though it contained but ninety-six pages,
divided into five parts. Although it is not great literature,
it is the first book that can, in any wise, come under
that term published in this State. It is surely of more
literary importance than Bradford's <i>Acts</i>. Rev. Rankin
was, as were nearly all of the early Kentucky theologians,
a prolific pamphleteer. His <i>Dialogues</i> (Lexington, 1810),
is really his most important publication, but it has been
greatly overlooked in the recent rush among Kentucky
historical writers to list <i>A Process</i> as the first book published in Kentucky. His eccentric career as a man and
preacher is, after all, of more interest than his work as an
author.</p>

<p class="center">ON THE EXTENT OF THE GOSPEL OFFER</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>A Process in the Transylvania Presbytery</i> (Lexington, Ky., 1793)]</p>

<p>We believe, that as it respects the outward means, the ambassadors
are authorised to publish, proclaim, and declare the counsel
of God, as it stands connected with our salvation; and that all,
who hear the sound, have an equal and indefinite warrant, not
only to embrace the means as offered to them indiscriminately,
by which comes faith, but have a right to believe, that Christ,
with all his benefits, is freely offered to them, as sinners, without
ever enquiring, into the secret purposes of God, whether they
are elect, or non-elect.</p>

<p class="center">[From the same]</p>

<p>Seeing, under our government, it is not purchasing a liberty
by pecuniary rewards, further, than compensating a prothonotary,
for taking bond and security, that guardians are agreed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
and keeping a just register, for the credit and safety of the rising
family. And as the contract is partly civil in its nature, and
civil government is bound to defend the civil rights&mdash;we believe
it perfectly consonant to the analogy of faith, which might be
evinced from the fourth chapter of Ruth. But as it is partly
social, and the parties contracting come under the mutual obligations
to fulfil their relative duties, it ought to be consummated
before witnesses. And as it is partly religious, every family appertaining
to the Church of Christ, commences a nursery, or infant
society, to train up their family in the nurture and admonition
of the Lord. We believe it right, that whenever a church
in full order exists, that the pastor, or church officer should consecrate
them, to the business assigned them as a Church of Christ,
taking their obligations for the due performance of their duty.</p>

<h2><a name="THOMAS_JOHNSON_Jr" id="THOMAS_JOHNSON_Jr">THOMAS JOHNSON, Jr.</a></h2>


<p>Thomas Johnson, Junior, the first Kentucky poet, who,
for many years, enjoyed the sobriquet of the "Drunken
Poet of Danville," was born in Virginia about 1760,
and he came to Kentucky when twenty-five years of age.
He settled at Danville, then a village, and immediately
entered into the role of poet, punster, and ne'er-do-weel.
Documentary evidence is extant to prove that Danville
was a gay little town when the young Virginian arrived
there about 1785; and he was early drawn into excesses,
or led others into them. Johnson was a rather prolific
maker of coarse satirical rhymes, which he finally assembled
into a small pamphlet, and published them as
<i>The Kentucky Miscellany</i> (Lexington, 1796). This was
the first book of poems, if they may be so termed, printed
in Kentucky. The original price of this pamphlet was
nine pence the copy, but it is impossible to procure it today
for any price, and there is not an extant copy of this
first edition. <i>The Kentucky Miscellany</i> went into a second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
edition in 1815, and a third edition was published a few
years later, but no copies of either edition are extant.
The fourth and final edition appeared from the <i>Advertiser</i>
office at Lexington, in 1821, and a dog-eared, much-mutilated
copy of this is in the collection of the Filson
Club in Louisville&mdash;perhaps the only copy in the world.
<i>The Miscellany</i> contained but thirty-six small pages,
about the size of the medical almanacs of to-day. Many
of the little verses are very vulgar and actually obscene,
perhaps due to the fact that Johnson could never quite
bury John Barleycorn alive. The most famous of them
is the <i>Extempore Grace</i>, which the bard delivered one day
in the tavern of old Erasmus Gill in Danville. In his cups
he stumbled into the tavern dining-room, where he found
the meal over, and the guests gone, nothing being left but
the crumbs. He glanced at the tables, then at Gill, and
offered <i>Extempore Grace</i>. His lines on Danville, on Kentucky,
and on several other subjects reveal the satirist;
and the verses to Polly, his sweetheart, and to his favorite
physician the better elements in his nature. That these
rather vulgar verses of Johnson did not escape the censorship
of Western advocates of the pure food law in literature,
is made certain by a letter from an Ohio critic
which appeared in the <i>Lexington Intelligencer</i> for January
28, 1834. After having made a strong plea for the
preservation of early Western verse, the writer added:
"I do not mean to embrace the low doggerel of <i>Tom Johnson</i>;
this was published some years ago, and I never felt
<i>decency</i> more outraged than when it was handed me to
read by <i>mine landlady</i>! My stars! Save us from the
<i>blackguardism</i>, for the world is sufficiently demoralized."
Had this early critic of Tom's verses presented a bundle
of them to some library, how many Western writers
would rise up and call him blessed! Johnson died and
was buried at Danville, but the date of his death or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
exact place of his burial is unknown. He had passed and
was almost forgotten by 1830.</p>

<h2><a name="GEORGE_BECK" id="GEORGE_BECK">GEORGE BECK</a></h2>


<p>George Beck, classicist, born in England in 1749, became
instructor of mathematics at Woolwich Academy, near
London, at the age of twenty-seven years; but he was later
dismissed. Beck married an English woman of culture
and emigrated to the United States in 1795, reaching
these shores in time to serve "Mad Anthony" Wayne as
a scout in his Indian campaign. The wanderlust was
upon George Beck, and he became one of the first of that
little band of nomadic painters that came early to the
Blue Grass country, and having once come remained. He
arrived at Lexington in 1800; and it was not long before
he began to send short original poems and spirited translations
of Anacreon, Homer, Horace, and Virgil to old
John Bradford's <i>Gazette</i>. At about this time, too, Beck
was doing many portraits and a group of landscapes in
oils of the Kentucky river country, a few of which have
come down to posterity. Eighteen hundred and six seems
to have been Beck's best year in Kentucky from the literary
viewpoint, as the <i>Gazette</i> is full of his verses and
translations. He was widely known as the "Lexington
Horace." Besides painting and poetry, George Beck was
a rather learned astronomer, as his <i>Observations on the
Comet</i> of 1811 prove. With his wife he conducted an
"Academy for Young Ladies" for several years. His last
years were much embittered by the lack of appreciation
upon the part of the Western public. The Kentucky of
1800 was not a whirlpool of art or literature by any means,
and this cultured man languished and finally died among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
a people who cared very little for his fine learning or his
manners. George Beck, poet, translator, mathematician,
astronomer, artist, died in Lexington, Kentucky, December
14, 1812. His wife survived him until the cholera
year of 1833, which swept away nearly two thousand citizens
of Lexington and the Blue Grass.</p>

<h2><a name="HUMPHREY_MARSHALL" id="HUMPHREY_MARSHALL">HUMPHREY MARSHALL</a></h2>


<p>Humphrey Marshall, author of the first <i>History of Kentucky</i>
that was in any wise comprehensive, was born
near Warrenton, Virginia, in 1760. What little school
instruction he received was from the young woman whom
he afterwards married. Marshall removed to Kentucky
in 1782, after having served as an officer in the Revolutionary
War. He was a member of the Virginia convention
of 1788, as a representative of the district of Kentucky,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
which adopted the Federal constitution. Marshall
was in the Kentucky legislature for several terms and,
from 1795 to 1801, he was United States Senator from
Kentucky. Some years later he was again in the State
legislature; and at about that time his famous duel with
Henry Clay took place. The first edition of his <i>History
of Kentucky</i> (Frankfort, 1812), appeared in a single volume
of 407 pages; but the second and final edition was
greatly revised and augmented and published in two octavo
volumes (Frankfort, 1824). Humphrey Marshall's
pen was pointed with poison for his enemies (and he had
more of them than any other Kentuckian of his time, perhaps),
and in his book he lashed them ruthlessly. He was
the first as well as the last of Kentucky's "personal" historians.
He first endeavored to silence his foes with
newspapers and pamphlets, but, not being satisfied with
the results, he poured out his wrath in book form to the
extent of a thousand pages and more. While prejudice is
the most descriptive word possible to use in characterizing
Marshall's work, it is not all prejudice. He wrote
with wonderful keenness concerning the Spanish conspiracy
in Kentucky, his views upon the men that were
guilty of bartering Kentucky to Spain in order to obtain
free navigation of the Mississippi river having been
abundantly affirmed by the latest historical work upon
that subject. He also wrote of the Burr conspiracy with
great clearness of vision, all of which is very remarkable
when one stops to consider that nearly every one of the
men connected with these two conspiracies were his bitterest
enemies. That Marshall was an able writer all of the
Kentucky historians have freely admitted, notwithstanding
the fact they have quarreled with his "copy" many
times. He is, as his biographer writes, "the stormy petrel
of Kentucky's earlier years," a most remarkable man
from several points of view. His <i>History of Kentucky</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
in either edition, is rather scarce at this time, and it is not
to be found in many of the rare book shops of the country.
Humphrey Marshall died at Lexington, Kentucky, July 3,
1841. He lies buried upon the banks of the Kentucky
river, near the capitol of the Commonwealth, Frankfort.</p>

<p>The country, once seen, held out abundant inducements to be
re-visited, and better known. Among the circumstances best
adapted to engage the attention, and impress the feelings of the
adventurous hunters of North Carolina, may be selected the uncommon
fertility of the soil, and the great abundance of wild
game, so conspicuous at that time. And we are assured that the
effect lost nothing of the cause. Forests those hunters had seen&mdash;mountains
they had ascended&mdash;valleys they had traversed&mdash;deer
they had killed&mdash;and bears they had successfully hunted.
They had heard the howl of the wolf; the whine of the panther;
and the heart-rending yell of the savage man; with correspondent
sensations of delight, or horror. But these were all lost to memory,
in the contemplation of Kentucky; animated with all the enchanting
variety, and adorned with all the majestic grace and
boldness of nature's creative energy. To nature's children, she
herself is eloquent, and affecting. Never before had the feelings
of these rude hunters experienced so much of the pathetic, the
sublime, or the marvellous. Their arrival on the plains of Elkhorn
was in the dawn of summer; when the forests, composed of
oaks of various kinds, of ash, of walnut, cherry, buck-eye, hackberry,
sugar trees, locust, sycamore, coffee tree, and an indefinite
number of other trees, towering aloft to the clouds, overspread
the luxuriant undergrowth, with their daily shade; while beneath,
the class of trees&mdash;the shrubs, the cane, the herbage, and the different
kinds of grass, and clover, interspersed with flowers, filled
the eye, and overlaid the soil, with the forest's richest carpet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
The soil itself, more unctuous and fertile than Egypt's boasted
Delta, from her maternal bosom, gave copious nutriment; and in
rich exuberance sustained the whole, in matchless verdure.</p>

<p>Here it was, if Pan ever existed, that without the aid of fiction,
he held his sole dominion, and Sylvan empire, unmolested by
Ceres, or Lucina, for centuries.</p>

<p>The proud face of creation here presented itself, without the
disguise of art. No wood had been felled; no field cleared; no
human habitation raised: even the red man of the forest had not
put up his wigwam of poles and bark for habitation. But that
mysterious Being, whose productive power we call Nature, ever
bountiful, and ever great&mdash;had not spread out this replete and
luxurious pasture without stocking it with numerous flocks and
herds: nor were their ferocious attendants, who prey upon them,
wanting, to fill up the circle of created beings. Here was seen
the timid deer; the towering elk; the fleet stag; the surly bear;
the crafty fox; the ravenous wolf; the devouring panther; the
insidious wild-cat; and the haughty buffaloe: besides innumerable
other creatures, winged, fourfooted, or creeping. And here,
at some time unknown, had been, for his bones are yet here, the
leviathan of the forest, the monstrous mammoth; whose trunk,
like that of the famous Trojan horse, would have held an host of
men; and whose teeth, nine feet in length, inflicted death and destruction,
on both animals and vegetable substances&mdash;until exhausting
all within its range, itself became extinct. Nor is it
known, although the race must have abounded in the country,
from the great number of bones belonging to the species, found in
different places, that there is one of the kind living on the American
continent, if in the universe.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>Stephen Theodore Badin, Kentucky's earliest Catholic
bard, was born at Orleans, France, in 1768. Though
very poor he received a classical and theological training
in Paris and Tours; and in 1792 he emigrated to
America. In the following year Badin was ordained
by Bishop John Carroll at Baltimore, he being the first
Roman Catholic priest ordained in the United States.
He was subsequently appointed to do missionary work
in Kentucky, which was then in the old Baltimore diocese,
and he made his home at Georgetown, Kentucky.
During the next few years Badin rode more than one hundred
thousand miles on horseback in order to meet all of
his appointments. He was then the only Catholic priest
in Kentucky, though he did have assistants from time to
time. In 1797 Badin was made vicar-general, and the
large Catholic emigrations from Maryland to Kentucky
about this time greatly increased his labors. His <i>Principles
of Catholics</i> (1805) was the first Catholic book published
in the West, and it gave him a larger audience than
his voice could well reach. Badin later organized missions
and built churches in Louisville and Lexington, St.
Peter's in Lexington being made possible by the generosity
of his Protestant friends, of whom he had many.
Badin and Bishop Benedict Joseph Flaget, of the Bardstown
diocese, had a misunderstanding as to the settlement
of titles to certain church properties which Badin had acquired
before Flaget came to Kentucky, and, rather than
to have an acrimonious argument with the Bishop, he quit
Kentucky, in 1819, and spent the next nine years in European
travel. From 1830 to 1836 he worked among the
Pottawatomie Indians in Indiana with marked success.
Father Badin died at Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1853. He was
the author of several Latin poems in hexameters, among
them being <i>Carmen Sacrum</i>, a translation of which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
published at Frankfort; <i>Epicedium</i>, an elegy upon
the death of Col. Joseph Hamilton Daviess at the battle of
Tippecanoe; and <i>Sanctissimae Trinitatis Laudes et Invocatis</i> (Louisville, 1843). His brief in memoriam for Colonel
Daviess is his best known work and, perhaps, his
masterpiece.</p>

<h2><a name="DR_CHARLES_CALDWELL" id="DR_CHARLES_CALDWELL">DR. CHARLES CALDWELL</a></h2>


<p>Dr. Charles Caldwell, versatile and voluminous writer
of prose, was born at Caswell, North Carolina, May 14,
1772. He entered the medical school of the University
of Pennsylvania, in 1792; and he won the city's gratitude
in the following year by his medical services during
the yellow fever epidemic. In 1810 Dr. Caldwell
became professor of natural history in the University of
Pennsylvania; and four years later he succeeded Nicholas
Biddle (1786-1844) as editor of <i>The Port-Folio</i>, a Philadelphia
magazine of high character. In 1819 Dr. Caldwell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
came to Lexington, Kentucky, to accept the chair of
materia medica in Transylvania University. Some
months later he was sent to Europe to purchase books and
apparatus for his department. He returned to Transylvania
and continued there until 1837, when he removed
to Louisville and established a medical institute. Some
years later he and the trustees disagreed and he left.
After leaving the institute, Dr. Caldwell continued to
reside at Louisville, in which city he died, July 9, 1853.
Dr. Caldwell was the first distinguished American practitioner
of phrenology, if he did not actually discover this
alleged science. From 1794 until his death, Dr. Caldwell
was an indefatigable literary worker. He was the author
of more than two hundred pamphlets, essays, and books.
He translated Blumenbach's <i>Elements of Physiology</i>
(1795); <i>Bachtiar Nameh</i> (1813), a Persian tale which he
translated from the Arabic; edited Cullen's <i>Practice of
Physic</i> (1816); <i>Memoirs of the Life and Campaigns of
the Hon.</i> [General] <i>Greene</i> (Philadelphia, 1819); <i>Elements
of Phrenology</i> (1824); <i>A Discourse on the Genius
and Character of the Rev. Horace Holley, LL.D., late
President of Transylvania University</i> (Boston, 1828);
and <i>Thoughts and Experiments on Mesmerism</i> (1842).</p>

<blockquote class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Bibliography</span>. His <i>Autobiography</i> (Philadelphia, 1855), published
posthumously, has been regarded by many as an unfortunate
work, as in it he made some rather severe pictures of his
contemporaries. That the work contains much excellent writing,
and is often very happy in the descriptions of the country
through which the author passed, no one has arisen to gainsay;

<p class="center">GENERAL GREENE'S EARLY LIFE</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>Memoirs of the Life and Campaigns of the Hon. Nathaniel Greene</i>
(Philadelphia, 1819)]</p>

<p>Nathaniel Greene, although descended from ancestors of elevated
standing, was not indebted to the condition of his family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
for any part of the real lustre and reputation he possessed. As
truly as is the case with any individual, he was the founder of his
own fortune, and the author of his own fame. He was the second
son of Nathaniel Greene, an anchor-smith, of considerable note,
who is believed to have had the earliest establishment of the kind
erected in America, and, by persevering industry in the line of
his profession, an extensive and lucrative concern in iron-works,
and some success in commercial transactions, had acquired a
sufficiency to render him comfortable, if not wealthy.</p>

<p>He was born in the year 1741, in the town of Warwick, and
county of Kent, in the province of Rhode Island. As far as is
known, his childhood passed without any peculiar or unequivocal
indications of future greatness. But this is a point of little
moment. The size of the oak it is destined to produce, can rarely
be foretold from an examination of the acorn. Nor is it often
that any well defined marks of genius in the child afford a premonition
of the eminence of the man.</p>

<p>Several of his contemporaries, however, who are still living,
have a perfect recollection that young Greene had neither the
appearance nor manners of a common boy; nor was he so considered
by his elder, and more discerning acquaintance.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>Being intended by his father for the business which he had
himself pursued, young Greene received at school nothing but
the elements of a common English education. But, to himself,
an acquisition so humble and limited, was unsatisfactory and
mortifying. Even now, his aim was lofty; and he had a noble
ambition, not only to embark in high pursuits, but to qualify
himself for a manly and honourable acquittance in them. Seeming,
at this early period of life, to realize the important truth
that, knowledge is power, a desire to obtain it became, in a short
time, his ruling passion.</p>

<p>He accordingly procured, in part by his own economy, the
necessary books, and, at intervals of leisure, acquired, chiefly
without the aid of an instructor, a competent acquaintance with
the Latin tongue.</p>

<p>This attainment, respectable in itself, was only preliminary to
higher efforts. With such funds as he was able to raise, he purchased
a small, but well selected library, and spent his evenings,
and all the time he could redeem from business, in regular study.
He read with a view to general improvement; but geography,
travels, and military history&mdash;the latter, more especially&mdash;constituted
his delight. Having, also, a predilection for mathematics
and mechanical philosophy, and pursuing, in most cases, the bent
of his inclination, as far as prudence and opportunity would admit,
his knowledge, in the more practical departments of these
sciences, became highly respectable.</p>

<h2><a name="ALLAN_B_MAGRUDER" id="ALLAN_B_MAGRUDER">ALLAN B. MAGRUDER</a></h2>


<p>Allan Bowie Magruder, poet and historian, was born in
Kentucky, about 1775. He received an academic education,
studied law, and was admitted to the Lexington bar
in 1797. He contributed very fair verse to the <i>Kentucky
Gazette</i> in 1802 and 1803, which attracted considerable
comment in the West. That his fame as a poet was
wide-spread, is indicated by a letter from an Ohio writer
published in the <i>Lexington Intelligencer</i>, January 28, 1834,
in which Magruder's verse is highly praised and further
information concerning his career is sought. After stabbing
poor Tom Johnson's little pamphlet of rhymes to the
heart, Magruder is placed upon his pedestal as the first
real Kentucky poet; and that his work was superior to
either Johnson's or George Beck's is obvious, continues
the caustic correspondent. The truth is, of course, that
the verses of neither of the three men merit mention for
anything save their priority; and the young Lexington
lawyer's muse was not as productive as Tom's or Beck's,
no more than three or four of his poems having come
down to us. His first prose work was entitled <i>Reflections
on the late Cession of Louisiana to the United
States</i> (Lexington, 1803). This little volume of 150 pages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
was issued by Daniel Bradford, for whose periodical,
<i>The Medley</i>, Magruder wrote <i>The Character of Thomas
Jefferson</i> (June; July, 1803). This essay attracted the
attention of the President, and he appointed Magruder
commissioner of lands in Louisiana, to which territory
he shortly afterwards removed. He was later a member
of the State legislature; and from November 18,
1812, to March 3, 1813, Magruder was United States
Senator from his adopted State. The next few years
he devoted to collecting materials for a history of
the North American Indians; and he also made notes for
many years for a history of Kentucky, which he finally
abandoned, and which he turned over to his old friend,
John Bradford, who made use of them in his <i>Notes on
Kentucky</i>. Allan B. Magruder died at Opelousas, Louisiana,
April 16, 1822, when but forty-seven years of age.
He was a man of culture and of high promise, but once in
the politics of the country his early literary triumphs
were not repeated, and he appears to have never done any
writing worth while after his removal from Kentucky.</p>

<p class="center">CITIZEN GENET AND JEFFERSON</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>The Medley</i> (Lexington, Ky., July, 1803)]</p>

<p>When Citizen Genet, the ex-minister of the Robesperian
fanaticism, appeared in America, he attempted to impose his new
philosophy of light and liberty upon the government. He had
nothing to boast of, on the score of superior diplomatic skill.
His communications to the secretary of state, were evidently of
the tampering kind. They were impressed with all the marks of
that enthusiastic insanity, which regulated the councils of the
faction; and which, were calculated to mistake their object, by
disgusting their intended victims. The mind of Mr. Jefferson,
discovered itself, in an early period of his correspondence with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
the French minister. The communications of Genet were decorated
with all the flowers of eloquence, without the force and
conviction of rhetorical energy. Accustomed to diplomatic calculation,
and intimately combining cause with effect, Mr. Jefferson
apprehended the subject, with strength and precision; considered
it&mdash;developed it&mdash;viewed it on all sides&mdash;listened to
every appeal, and attended to every charge&mdash;and in every communication,
burst forth with a strength of refutation, that at
once detected and embarrassed, the disappointed minister of a
wily and fanatic faction.</p>

<p>It is, in most instances, useless to oppose enthusiasm with the
deliberate coolness of reason and argument. They are the antipodes
of each other; and of that imperious nature, which mutually
solicit triumph and disdain reconciliation. The tyranny of
the Robesperian principles, were calculated to inveigle within the
vortex of European politics, the American government and people.
The coolness and sagacity of the secretary of state, composed
their defence and protection. The appeal was mutually
made to the government; and it is a fortunate circumstance, that
there existed this tribunal to approbate the measures of the secretary,
and to silence forever, the declamatory oracle of an insidious
faction. Checked and defeated on all sides, his doctrines stripped
of their visionary principles, and himself betrayed into the labyrinth
of diplomatic mystery, their ex-divinity, shrank into the
silence of contempt; declaring with his last breath, that Mr. Jefferson
was the only man in America, whose talents he highly
respected.</p>

<h2><a name="HENRY_CLAY" id="HENRY_CLAY">HENRY CLAY</a></h2>


<p>Henry Clay, the most famous Kentuckian ever born,
first saw the light in the "Slashes," Hanover county,
Virginia, April 12, 1777. When twenty years of age,
he settled in Lexington, Kentucky, as a lawyer; and
Lexington was his home henceforth. In 1803 Henry Clay
was elected to the State legislature; and before he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
thirty years old he was filling an unexpired term in the
United States Senate. In 1811 he was sent to the National
House of Representatives from the old Lexington district.
He was immediately chosen Speaker of that body, a position
to which he was subsequently elected five times. This
was the period of his greatest speeches. His utterances
upon American rights did much to bring about the War of
1812. In 1814 Henry Clay went to Europe as a peace
commissioner, and the Treaty of Ghent was signed on December
24, 1814. He had resigned the Speakership in
order to go to Ghent, but on his return in 1815, he found
himself relected; and he presided as Speaker until 1820,
declining two diplomatic posts and two cabinet offices in
order to continue in the chair. In 1820 Henry Clay advocated
the Missouri Compromise, and a short time afterwards
he retired from public life to devote his attention
to his private affairs. He was, however, in 1823, again
elected to the lower House of Congress, and was again
chosen Speaker, serving as such until 1825. In 1824 he
announced himself as a candidate for president, but he
was defeated by John Quincy Adams, who made him his
Secretary of State. Andrew Jackson was elected president,
in 1828, and Mr. Clay&mdash;to give him the name he
was always known by, regardless of the many positions he
held&mdash;once more retired from American politics. In 1831
the people elected him United States Senator from Kentucky,
and in that body he fought Jackson's policies so
strenuously that the Whig party was born, with Mr. Clay
as its legitimate parent. The Whigs nominated him as
their first candidate for president, but he was overwhelmingly
defeated by his old-time enemy, Andrew Jackson.
He was the author of the Compromise tariff of 1832-1833,
which did much toward winning him the sobriquet of the
"Great Compromiser." Mr. Clay was relected to the
Senate, in 1837; and two years later his great debates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
with John C. Calhoun took place. Late in this year of
1839, the Whig political bosses set him aside and nominated
William Henry Harrison for president and he was
elected. In 1842 Henry Clay was retired to private life for
the third time, but two years later he was again the candidate
of the Whigs for president, and he was defeated by a
comparatively unknown man, James K. Polk of Tennessee&mdash;the
only Speaker of the House who has ever been elected
president of the United States. The year of 1849 found
Henry Clay once more in the Senate, but he was now old
and very feeble. The great Compromise of 1850 sapped
his rapidly waning strength, though it greatly added to
his fame as a statesman. On June 29, 1852, Henry Clay
died at Washington City, in the seventy-sixth year of his
age. His body was brought back to the land he loved so
well, and to which he had brought world-wide fame, and
was buried at Lexington, where a grateful people have
erected a cloud-tipped monument to his memory. He is
one of the American immortals, though it is not at all
difficult to quarrel with many of his public acts. He
carried the name and fame of Kentucky into the remotest
corners of the universe, and it would be indeed surprising
if it were not possible to find flaws in a record that
was as long as his. His connection with the Graves-Cilley
duel in 1838 appears unpardonable at this time, but
perhaps the whole truth regarding this infamous affair
has not yet been brought out. Considering the patent
fact that few orators can stand the printed page, and that
the methods by which Clay's addresses were preserved
were crude and unsatisfactory, many of the speeches are
very readable even unto this day. They undoubtedly
prove, however, that the man behind them, and not the
manner or matter of them, was the thing that made Henry
Clay the most lovable character in American history.</p>

<p>Sir, I am growing old. I have had some little measure of experience
in public life, and the result of that experience has
brought me to this conclusion, that when business, of whatever
nature, is to be transacted in a deliberative assembly, or in private
life, courtesy, forebearance, and moderation, are best calculated
to bring it to a successful conclusion. Sir, my age admonishes
me to abstain from involving myself in personal difficulties;
would to God that I could say, I am also restrained by higher motives.
I certainly never sought any collision with the gentleman
from Virginia. My situation at this time is peculiar, if it be nothing
else, and might, I should think, dissuade, at least, a generous
heart from any wish to draw me into circumstances of personal
altercation. I have experienced this magnanimity from some
quarters of the house. But I regret, that from others it appears
to have no such consideration. The gentleman from Virginia
was pleased to say, that in one point at least he coincided
with me&mdash;in an humble estimate of my grammatical and philological
acquirements, I know my deficiencies. I was born to
no proud patrimonial estate; from my father I inherited only
infancy, ignorance, and indigence. I feel my defects; but, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
far as my situation in early life is concerned, I may, without presumption,
say they are more my misfortune than my fault. But,
however I regret my want of ability to furnish to the gentleman
a better specimen of powers of verbal criticism, I will venture to
say, it is not greater than the disappointment of this committee
as to the strength of his argument.</p>


<p class="center">ADDRESS TO LA FAYETTE</p>

<p class="center">[From the same]</p>

<p>General,</p>

<p>The house of representatives of the United States, impelled
alike by its own feelings, and by those of the whole American
people, could not have assigned to me a more gratifying duty
than that of presenting to you cordial congratulations upon the
occasion of your recent arrival in the United States, in compliance
with the wishes of Congress, and to assure you of the very
high satisfaction which your presence affords on this early theatre
of your glory and renown. Although but few of the members
who compose this body shared with you in the war of our revolution,
all have, from impartial history, or from faithful tradition,
a knowledge of the perils, the sufferings, and the sacrifices, which
you voluntarily encountered, and the signal services, in America
and in Europe, which you performed for an infant, a distant,
and an alien people; and all feel and own the very great extent
of the obligations under which you have placed our country.
But the relations in which you have ever stood to the United
States, interesting and important as they have been, do not constitute
the only motive of the respect and admiration which the
house of representatives entertain for you. Your consistency of
character, your uniform devotion to regulated liberty, in all the
vicissitudes of a long and arduous life, also commands its admiration.
During all the recent convulsions of Europe, amidst, as
after the dispersion of, every political storm, the people of the
United States have beheld you, true to your old principles, firm
and erect, cheering and animating with your well-known voice,
the votaries of liberty, its faithful and fearless champion, ready
to shed the last drop of that blood which here you so freely and
nobly spilt, in the same holy cause.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>The vain wish has been sometimes indulged, that Providence
would allow the patriot, after death, to return to his country, and
to contemplate the intermediate changes which had taken place;
to view the forest felled, the cities built, the mountains levelled,
the canals cut, the highways constructed, the progress of the arts,
advancement of learning, and the increase of population. General,
your present visit to the United States is a realization of the
consoling object of that wish. You are in the midst of posterity.
Every where, you must have been struck with the great changes,
physical and moral, which have occurred since you left us. Even
this very city, bearing a venerated name, alike endeared to you
and to us, has since emerged from the forest which then covered
its site. In one respect you behold us unaltered, and this is in
the sentiment of continued devotion to liberty, and of ardent
affection and profound gratitude to your departed friend, the
father of his country, and to you, and to your illustrious associates
in the field and in the cabinet, for the multiplied blessings
which surround us, and for the very privilege of addressing you
which I now exercise. This sentiment, now fondly cherished by
more than ten millions of people, will be transmitted, with unabated
vigor, down the tide of time, through the countless millions
who are destined to inhabit this continent, to the latest
posterity.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<h2><a name="JOHN_J_AUDUBON" id="JOHN_J_AUDUBON">JOHN J. AUDUBON</a></h2>


<p>John James Audubon, the celebrated ornithologist, was
born at Mandeville, Louisiana, May 5, 1780. He was educated
in France under private tutors, but his consuming
love of Nature and especially of bird-life, was too strong
to keep him in a beaten path of study, so most of his time
was spent in the woods and fields. When seventeen years
old Audubon returned to the United States to settle upon
his father's estate, "Mill Grove," near Philadelphia.
There he devoted his entire time to hunting, fishing, drawing,
and music. Some months later he met and fell in
love with his nearest neighbor, Lucy Bakewell, a young
English girl. "Too young and too useless to be married,"
as he himself afterwards wrote, his about-to-be father-in-law,
William Bakewell, advised Audubon to become a New
York business man. With his friend, Ferdinand Rozier,
whom he had met in France, and who was then connected
with a French firm in Philadelphia, he visited Kentucky,
late in 1806, "thought well of it, and liked it exceedingly."
But his great love of Nature was not to be denied,
and his business suffered accordingly. On April 8, 1808,
Audubon was married to Miss Bakewell, and the next
morning left for Pittsburgh, where he and his bride, accompanied
by Rozier, floated down the Ohio river in a flatboat,
which was their bridal tour, with Louisville, Kentucky,
as their destination. Upon reaching Louisville
Audubon and Rozier opened a large store which prospered
when Audubon attended to it; "but birds were birds then
as now, and my thoughts were ever and anon turning toward
them as the objects of my greatest delight." His
first child, Victor, was born at Louisville, in 1809.
Rozier conducted the store, and Audubon spent his days
in "the darling forests." In 1810 Alexander Wilson, the
Scotch ornithologist and poet, called upon Audubon at his
store in Louisville hoping to obtain his subscription to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
work upon American birds, but Audubon showed him
birds he had never seen before, which seemingly angered
the Scot as he afterwards wrote slightingly of the Kentucky
naturalist. Late in 1810 Audubon and Rozier removed
their stock of goods to Henderson, Kentucky,
where their trade was so poor that Rozier was left behind
the counter, while Audubon was compelled to fish and hunt
for food. A short time after their arrival in Henderson,
the two partners decided to move to St. Genevieve on the
Mississippi river, but Audubon disliked the community,
sold out to Rozier, and returned to his home in Henderson.
His second son, John Woodhouse, was born at Henderson,
in 1812. Two daughters were also born at Henderson,
the first of whom, Lucy, died in infancy and
was buried in her father's garden. His pecuniary affairs
were now greatly reduced, but he continued to
draw birds and quadrupeds. He disposed of Mill Grove
and opened a small store in Henderson, which prospered
and put him on his feet again. Audubon was doing so
finely in business now that he purchased a small farm
and was adding to it from time to time. His brother-in-law,
Thomas Bakewell, arrived at Henderson about 1816,
and finally persuaded Audubon to erect a steam-mill on his
property at a great expense. For a time this mill did all
the sawing for the country, but in the end it ruined Audubon
and his partners. He left Henderson in 1819, after
having resided in the town for nearly ten years, and set up
as a portrait painter in Louisville, where he was very successful.
From Louisville Audubon went to Cincinnati
and from there to New Orleans. In October, 1823, he
again settled at Louisville as a painter of "birds, landscapes,
portraits, and even signs." His wife was the only
person in the world who had any faith in his ultimate
"arrival" as a famous naturalist, and the outlook was indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
dark. Audubon quitted Louisville in March, 1824,
and two years later he went to England, where the first
public exhibition of his drawings was held. His first and
most famous work, <i>Birds of America</i>, was published at
London from 1827 to 1838, issued in numbers, each containing
five plates, without text, the complete work consisting
of four folio volumes. Audubon returned to America
in 1829, and he was with his sons at Louisville for a
short time, both of whom were engaged in business there.
He went to New Orleans to see his wife, and together they
came to Louisville, in 1830, to bid the "Kentucky lads,"
as he called them, goodbye, before sailing for England.
At "the fair Edinburgh," in the fall of 1830, Audubon
began the <i>Ornithological Biographies</i> (Edinburgh, 1831-39,
5 vols.), the text to the plates of the <i>Birds</i>. In 1840-44
the work was republished in seven volumes, text and
plates together, as <i>Birds of America</i>. In 1831 Audubon
and his wife returned to America, and they were again in
Louisville with the boys for some time. In 1833 his
famous trip to Labrador was taken, and the following
year found the family in England. The next ten years
were passed in wandering from country to country in
search of birds, but, in 1842, Audubon purchased "Minniesland,"
now Audubon Park, New York. With his sons
and the Rev. John Bachman he planned the <i>Quadrupeds
of America</i>, the last volume of which was issued after his
death, which occurred at "Minniesland" on January 27,
1851. His wife, who wrote his life, survived him many
years, dying at Shelbyville, Kentucky, June 19, 1874, but
she is buried by his side on the banks of the Hudson.</p>

<p class="center">INDIAN SUMMER ON THE OHIO IN 1810<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p class="center">[From <i>Audubon and His Journals</i>, edited by Maria R. Audubon (New York,
1900, v. ii)]</p>

<p>When my wife, my eldest son (then an infant), and myself
were returning from Pennsylvania to Kentucky, we found it expedient,
the waters being unusually low, to provide ourselves
with a <i>skiff</i>, to enable us to proceed to our abode at Henderson.
I purchased a large, commodious, and light boat of that denomination.
We procured a mattress, and our friends furnished
us with ready prepared viands. We had two stout negro rowers,
and in this trim we left the village of Shippingport [now within
the corporate limits of Louisville], in expectation of reaching
the place of our destination in a very few days.</p>

<p>It was in the month of October. The autumnal tints already
decorated the shores of that queen of rivers, the Ohio. Every
tree was hung with long and flowing festoons of different species
of vines, many loaded with clustered fruits of varied brilliancy,
their rich bronzed carmine mingling beautifully with the yellow
foliage which now predominated over the yet green leaves, reflecting
more lively tints from the clear stream than ever landscape
painter portrayed, or poet imagined. The days were yet
warm. The sun had assumed the rich and glowing hue which at
that season produces the singular phenomenon called there the
"Indian Summer." The moon had rather passed the meridian
of her grandeur. We glided down the river, meeting no other
ripple of the water than that formed by the propulsion of our
boat. Leisurely we moved along, gazing all day on the grandeur
and beauty of the wild scenery around us.</p>

<p>Now and then a large catfish rose to the surface of the water,
in pursuit of a shoal of fry, which, starting simultaneously from
the liquid element like so many silver arrows, produced a shower
of light, while the pursuer with open jaws seized the stragglers,
and, with a splash of his tail, disappeared from our view. Other
fishes we heard, uttering beneath our bark a rumbling noise, the
strange sound of which we discovered to proceed from the white
perch, for on casting our net from the bow, we caught several of
that species, when the noise ceased for a time.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>
<p>Nature, in her varied arrangements, seems to have felt a partiality
towards this portion of our country. As the traveler
ascends or descends the Ohio, he cannot help remarking that alternately,
nearly the whole length of the river, the margin, on
one side, is bounded by lofty hills and a rolling surface, while
on the other, extensive plains of the richest alluvial land are seen
as far as the eye can command the view. Islands of varied size
and form rise here and there from the bosom of the water, and
the winding course of the stream frequently brings you to places
where the idea of being on a river of great length changes to that
of floating on a lake of moderate extent. Some of these islands
are of considerable size and value; while others, small and insignificant,
seem as if intended for contrast, and as serving to enhance
the general interest of the scenery. These little islands
are frequently overflowed during great freshets or floods, and
receive at their heads prodigious heaps of drifted timber. We
foresaw with great concern the alterations that cultivation would
soon produce along those delightful banks.</p>

<p>As night came, sinking in darkness the broader portions of the
river, our minds became affected by strong emotions, and wandered
far beyond the present moments. The tinkling of bells told us that
the cattle which bore them were gently roving from valley to
valley in search of food, or returning to their distant homes. The
hooting of the Great Owl, or the muffled noise of its wings, as it
sailed smoothly over the stream, were matters of interest to us;
so was the sound of the boatman's horn, as it came winding more
and more softly from afar. When daylight returned, many songsters
burst forth with echoing notes, more and more mellow to
the listening ear. Here and there the lonely cabin of a squatter
struck the eye, giving note of commencing civilization. The
crossing of the stream by a Deer foretold how soon the hills would
be covered with snow.</p>

<p>Many sluggish flatboats we overtook and passed; some laden
with produce from the different head-waters of the small rivers
that pour their tributary streams into the Ohio; others, of
less dimensions, crowded with emigrants from distant parts, in
search of a new home. Purer pleasures I never felt; nor have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
you, reader, I ween, unless indeed you have felt the like, and in
such company.</p>

<p>The margins of the shores and of the river were, at this season
amply supplied with game. A Wild Turkey, a Grouse, or a Blue-winged
Teal, could be procured in a few moments; and we fared
well, for, whenever we pleased we landed, struck up a fire, and
provided as we were with the necessary utensils, procured a good
repast.</p>

<p>Several of these happy days passed, and we neared our home,
when, one evening, not far from Pigeon Creek (a small stream
which runs into the Ohio from the State of Indiana), a loud and
strange noise was heard, so like the yells of Indian warfare, that
we pulled at our oars, and made for the opposite side as fast and
as quietly as possible. The sounds increased, we imagined we
heard cries of "murder;" and as we knew that some depredations
had lately been committed in the country by dissatisfied parties
of aborigines, we felt for a while extremely uncomfortable. Ere
long, however, our minds became more calmed, and we plainly
discovered that the singular uproar was produced by an enthusiastic
set of Methodists, who had wandered thus far out of the
common way for the purpose of holding one of their annual camp-meetings,
under the shade of a beech forest. Without meeting
with any other interruption, we reached Henderson, distant from
Shippingport, by water, about two hundred miles.</p>

<p>When I think of these times, and call back to my mind the
grandeur and beauty of those almost uninhabited shores; when I
picture to myself the dense and lofty summits of the forests, that
everywhere spread along the hills and overhung the margins of
the stream, unmolested by the axe of the settler; when I know
how dearly purchased the safe navigation of that river has been,
by the blood of many worthy Virginians; when I see that no
longer any aborigines are to be found there, and that the vast
herds of Elk, Deer, and Buffaloes which once pastured on these
hills, and in these valleys, making for themselves great roads to
the several salt-springs, have ceased to exist; when I reflect that
all this grand portion of our Union, instead of being in a state of
nature, is now more or less covered with villages, farms, and
towns, where the din of hammers and machinery is constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
heard; that the woods are fast disappearing under the axe by
day, and the fire by night; that hundreds of steamboats are gliding
to and fro, over the whole length of the majestic river, forcing
commerce to take root and to prosper at every spot; when I see
the surplus population of Europe coming to assist in the destruction
of the forest, and transplanting civilization into its darkest
recesses; when I remember that these extraordinary changes have
all taken place in the short period of twenty years, I pause, wonder,
and although I know all to be a fact, can scarcely believe its
reality.</p>

<p>Whether these changes are for the better or for the worse, I
shall not pretend to say; but in whatever way my conclusions
may incline, I feel with regret that there are on record no satisfactory
accounts of the state of that portion of the country, from
the time when our people first settled in it. This has not been
because no one in America is able to accomplish such an undertaking.
Our Irvings and our Coopers have proved themselves
fully competent for the task. It has more probably been because
the changes have succeeded each other with such rapidity as
almost to rival the movements of their pens. However, it is not
too late yet; and I sincerely hope that either or both of them
will ere long furnish the generations to come with those delightful
descriptions which they are so well qualified to give, of the
original state of a country that has been rapidly forced to change
her form and attire under the influence of increasing population.
Yes, I hope to read, ere I close my earthly career, accounts from
those delightful writers of the progress of civilization in our
Western Country. They will speak of the Clarks, the Croghans,
the Boones, and many other men of great and daring enterprise.
They will analyze, as it were, into each component part the country
as it once existed, and will render the picture, as it ought to be,
immortal.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="HORACE_HOLLEY" id="HORACE_HOLLEY">HORACE HOLLEY</a></h2>


<p>Horace Holley, old Transylvania University's celebrated
president, was born at Salisbury, Connecticut, February
13, 1781, the son of Luther Holley, a wealthy merchant.
He was fitted at Williams College for Yale, from which
institution he was graduated in 1803. Holley studied law
in New York for awhile, but soon relinquished it for theology,
which he returned to Yale to pursue. In 1805 he
was appointed to his first pastorate. Going to Boston in
1809, as pastor of the Hollis Street Unitarian church, he
at once made a great reputation for himself as an eloquent
pulpit orator. Holley was at Hollis Street for nine years,
during which time he was a member of the Board of Overseers
of Harvard University, as well as a member of several
civic boards. He was elected president of Transylvania
University, of Lexington, in 1817, and he journeyed
to Kentucky in the following spring, where he went carefully
over the ground and finally decided to accept the position.
He entered almost at once upon the most difficult
task of converting a grammar school into a great university.
Success soon crowned his efforts, however, and Transylvania
took her place by the side of Harvard, Yale, and
Princeton, as one of the higher seats of learning in the
United States. In at least one year under the Holley
rgime, Transylvania had the largest student body in this
country. The institution was as well known in New York
or London, among scholars, as it was in the West. Several
of the professors were men of national reputation,
and the students came from all parts of the United States.
Never before in the South or West has a seat of learning
had higher hopes for the future, or greater success or reputation
than had Transylvania under Horace Holley.
Then the Kentucky Presbyterians and others launched
Dame Rumor, freighted with falsehoods and misrepresentations
galore. The president was charged with every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
crime in the calendar: he was an atheist, an agnostic, a
blasphemer, a wine-bibber, and all that was evil. The
whole truth was this: he was a Unitarian, holding the
Christ to be the greatest personality in history, but denying
him as the very Son of God. This his prejudiced, ill-advised
enemies were unable to understand. Driven to
desperation by the bitter crusade that was being waged
against him, Holley resigned, in March, 1827, after nine
years of great success as head of the University, which
after his departure, fell away to almost nothing. He
went from Kentucky to Louisiana, where he endeavored
to re-organize the College of New Orleans, and in which
work he wore himself out. Late in the summer he and
his wife took passage for New York, but he contracted
yellow-fever, and, on July 31, 1827, he died. His body
was consigned to the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, but his
fame is secure as an American educator of distinguished
ability. The finest bit of prose he ever wrote, perhaps, is
contained in one of his Kentucky letters to his wife in
Boston, written while he was in Lexington looking over
the lay of the land, which, as subsequent events proved, he
utterly failed to anticipate in its most dangerous and
damning aspect.</p>

<p>I wrote a hasty letter to you on the night of my arrival. I
shall now he able to speak a little more in detail.</p>

<p>The town and the vicinity are very handsome. The streets are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
broad, straight, paved, clean, and have rows of trees on each side.
The houses are of brick almost universally, many of them in the
midst of fields, and have a very rural and charming appearance.
The taste is for low houses, generally two, sometimes even but one
story high, like English cottages. This taste gives an effect that
eyes accustomed to the high buildings of an Atlantic city, where
there is but little room, are not at first pleased with. But it is a
taste adapted to the circumstances, and to me is not unpleasant.</p>

<p>I have taken lodgings at the principal hotel of the place, where
I have a drawing-room to receive calls, which were yesterday until
dinner almost innumerable.... In the afternoon I walked
about town with Mr. Clay, and called at a few charming houses.
I visited also the Athenaeum, an institution not yet furnished
with many books, but well supplied with newspapers, and the
best periodicals. I find everything of this sort, which is valuable,
from Boston and the other Atlantic cities.</p>

<p>This morning I breakfasted at Mr. Clay's, who lives a mile and
a half from town. He arrived here only three days before me.
Ashland is a very pleasant place, handsomer than I anticipated.
The grounds are beautiful, the lawns and walks extensive, the
shrubbery luxuriant, and the garden well supplied. The native
forest of ash in the rear adds a charming effect to the whole.
After breakfast Mr. Clay rode in with me, and we went with the
trustees, by appointment, to the college, to visit the professors
and students. They were all collected in the largest hall to receive
us. I made a short address, which was received in a kind
manner. I was then conducted to the library, the apparatus,
and the recitation rooms. The library is small, and the apparatus
smaller. There is no regular division of students into classes
as in other colleges, and but few laws. Everything is to be done,
and so much the better, as nothing is to be reformed. Almost
the whole is proposed to be left to me to arrange. I am now
making all necessary inquiries, and a meeting of the trustees is
to be called next week.</p>

<p>After this visit, I went with a party of ladies and gentlemen,
nine miles into the country to the seat of Colonel [David] Meade
[1744-1838] where we dined and passed the day. This gentleman,
who is near seventy, is a Virginian of the old school. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
has been a good deal in England, in his youth, and brought home
with him English notions of a country seat, though he is a great
republican in politics. He and his wife dress in the costume of
the olden time. He has the square coat and great cuffs, the vest
of the court, short breeches, and white stockings, at all times.
Mrs. Meade has the long waist, the white apron, the stays, the
ruffles about the elbows, and the cap of half a century ago. She
is very mild and ladylike, and though between sixty and seventy,
plays upon the piano-forte with the facility and cheerfulness of a
young lady. Her husband resembles Colonel Pickering in the
face, and the shape of the head. He is entirely a man of leisure,
never having followed any business, and never using his fortune
but in adorning his place and entertaining his friends and strangers.
No word is ever sent to him that company is coming. To
do so offends him. But a dinner&mdash;he dines at the hour of four&mdash;is
always ready for visitors; and servants are always in waiting.
Twenty of us went out today, without warning, and were
entertained luxuriously on the viands of the country. Our drink
consisted of beer, toddy, and water. Wine, being imported and
expensive, he never gives; nor does he allow cigars to be smoked
in his presence. His house consists of a cluster of rustic cottages,
in front of which spreads a beautiful, sloping lawn, as smooth as
velvet. From this diverge, in various direction, and forming vistas
terminated by picturesque objects, groves and walks extending
over some acres. Seats, Chinese temples, verdant banks, and
alcoves are interspersed at convenient distances. The lake, over
which presides a Grecian temple, that you may imagine to be the
residence of the water nymphs, has in it a small island, which
communicates with the shore by a white bridge of one arch. The
whole is surrounded by a low rustic fence of stone, surmounted
and almost hidden by honey-suckle and roses, now in full flower,
and which we gathered in abundance to adorn the ladies. Everything
is laid out for walking and pleasure. His farm he rents,
and does nothing for profit. The whole is in rustic taste. You
enter from the road, through a gate between rude and massive
columns, a field without pretension, wind a considerable distance
through a noble park to an inner gate, the capitals to whose pillars
are unique, being formed of the roots of trees, carved by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
nature. Then the rich scene of cultivation, of verdure and flower-capped
hedges, bursts upon you. There is no establishment
like this in our country. Instead of a description, I might have
given you its name, "<i>Chaumiere du Prairies</i>."</p>

<h2><a name="CONSTANTINE_S_RAFINESQUE" id="CONSTANTINE_S_RAFINESQUE">CONSTANTINE S. RAFINESQUE</a></h2>


<p>Constantine Samuel Rafinesque, the learned, eccentric
scientist of Kentucky and the West, was born near Constantinople,
Turkey, October 22, 1783. He was of French-German
descent. His boyhood years were spent in Italy
and in traveling on the Continent. Rafinesque came to
America in 1802, and he remained in this country but three
years, when he returned to Italy; and there the subsequent
ten years of his life were passed. In 1809 he married,
after a fashion, a Sicilian woman, Josephine Vaccaro,
who bore him two children. Rafinesque returned to America
in 1815, and a short time after his arrival, he met
his former friend, John D. Clifford, of Philadelphia and
Lexington&mdash;twin-towns in those days&mdash;"the only man
he ever loved," who persuaded him to come out to Kentucky.
At Henderson, Kentucky, Rafinesque met the
great Audubon, who took him under his roof, and who
told him many amusing tales of the fishes of the Ohio&mdash;which
the little scientist believed, as coming from a famous
man&mdash;and which caused him no end of trouble and
work in after years. Audubon ridiculed him to his face,
which the simple-minded man could not understand;
and in his <i>Journals</i> the ornithologist has much fun at
his guest's expense. That he treated him very badly, no
one can deny. Through Clifford's influence, probably,
Rafinesque was appointed, in 1819, to the chair of natural
science and modern languages in Transylvania University.
This was during the presidency of Horace Holley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
when the old University was at the high-tide of its history,
but the diminutive scientist, though heralded as "the most
learned man in America," was not received as such in the
Blue Grass region of Kentucky an hundred years ago.
From the president down to the children of the little city
he was looked upon as an impossible creature. Seven of
the best years of his life were spent in the service of the
University and of the town. His boldest dream for the
town was a Botanical Garden, modeled upon the gardens
of France, and though he did actually make a splendid
start toward this ideal, in the end all his plans came to
nothing. In June, 1825, Rafinesque left Lexington, never
to return. He went to Philadelphia, where the remaining
fifteen years of his life were spent. Death discovered the
little fellow among his books, plants, and poverty, September
18, 1840, in a miserable, rat-ridden garret on Race
street, Philadelphia. Rafinesque's publications reach the
surprising number of 447, consisting of books, pamphlets,
magazine articles, translations, and reprints. His most
important works are <i>Ichthyologia Ohiensis, or Natural
History of the Fishes Inhabiting the River Ohio and its
Tributary Streams</i> (Lexington, 1820), a reprint of which
his biographer, Dr. Call, has published (Cleveland,
1899); and his <i>Ancient Annals of Kentucky</i>, which
Humphrey Marshall printed as an introduction to his
<i>History of Kentucky</i> (Frankfort, 1824). The oversheets
of this were made into a pamphlet of thirty-nine pages.
The little work considers the antiquities of the State, and
is the starting point for all latter-day writers upon "the
prehistoric men of Kentucky." Imagination and fact
run riotously together, yet the work has been correctly
characterized as "the most remarkable history of Kentucky
that was ever written, or ever will be."</p>

NATURE IN KENTUCKY</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>Ancient Annals of Kentucky</i> (Frankfort, Kentucky, 1824)]</p>

<p>1. Every complete history of a country ought to include an
account of the physical changes and revolutions, which it may
have undergone.</p>

<p>2. The documents for such geological survey, are to be found
everywhere in the bowels of the earth, its rocks and strata, with
the remains of organized bodies imbedded therein, which are now
considered as the medals of nature.</p>

<p>3. The soil of Kentucky shows, like many other countries, that
it has once been the bed of the sea. In James's Map, the primitive
ocean is supposed to have covered North America, by having a
former level of 6000 feet above the actual level. Since the highest
lands in Kentucky do not exceed 1800 feet above the level of
the actual ocean, they were once covered with at least 4200 feet
of water.</p>

<p>4. The study of the soil of Kentucky, proves evidently the
successive and gradual retreat of the salt waters, without evincing
any proofs of any very violent or sudden disruptions or emersions
of land, nor eruptions of the ocean, except some casual accidents,
easily ascribed to earthquakes, salses and submarine volcanoes.</p>

<p>5. There are no remains of land or burning volcanoes in Kentucky,
nor of any considerable fresh water lake. All the strata
are nearly horizontal, with valleys excavated by the tides and
streams during the soft state of the strata.</p>

<p>6. After these preliminary observations, I shall detail the
successive evolution of this soil and its productions, under six
distinct periods of time, which may be compared to the six epochs
or days of creation, and supposed to have lasted an indefinite
number of ages.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="MANN_BUTLER" id="MANN_BUTLER">MANN BUTLER</a></h2>


<p>Mann Butler, the first Kentucky historian who worked
with comparatively modern methods, eliminating personal
prejudices and imagination, was born at Baltimore,
July, 1784. At the age of three years he was taken to the
home of his grandfather in Chelsea, England. Mann
Butler returned to the United States, in 1798, and entered
St. Mary's College, Georgetown, D. C., from which institution
he was afterwards graduated in the arts, medicine,
and law. His tastes were decidedly literary, and he preferred
law to medicine as being, perhaps, more in line with
literature. He emigrated to Kentucky, locating at Lexington,
in 1806, for the practice of law. He later abandoned
law for pedagogy, opening an academy at Versailles,
Kentucky. Some years later he taught in Maysville
and Frankfort, and was then called to a professorship
in Transylvania University, Lexington, where he remained
for several years. In 1831 Butler removed to
Louisville, where he was engaged in teaching for fifteen
years. His <i>History of Kentucky</i> (Louisville, 1834; Cincinnati,
1836) was, after Filson's florid sentences, Rafinesque's
imagination, and Marshall's prejudices and castigations,
most welcome and timely. He was microscopic in
finding facts, fair, having no enemies to punish, an excellent
chronicler, in short, and doing a work that was much
needed. The Kentucky legislature took a keen interest
in his history, rendering him great assistance. Butler's
<i>Appeal from the Misrepresentations of James Hall, Respecting
the History of Kentucky and the West</i> (Frankfort,
1837), was a just criticism of the Cincinnati writer's
<i>Sketches of History in the West</i> (Philadelphia, 1835),
a work in which fact and fiction are well-nigh inseparable.
Mann Butler spent the last seven years of his life in St.
Louis, teaching and in preparing a history of the Ohio
valley, which he left in manuscript, but which, together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
with his library, was afterwards destroyed by Federal soldiers
during the Civil War. He was killed in Missouri,
in 1852, while a passenger on a Pacific train which was
wrecked by the falling of a bridge spanning the Gasconade
river. Mann Butler had many of the qualities required
in a great historian, and the work he did has lived
well and will live longer.</p>

<p class="center">PIONEER VISITORS</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>A History of the Commonwealth of Kentucky</i> (Louisville, Kentucky,
1834)]</p>

<p>During this same year [1769], a party of about forty stout
hunters, "from New River, Holstein and Clinch" united in a
hunting expedition west of the Cumberland Mountains.</p>

<p>Nine of this party, led on by Col. James Knox, reached Kentucky;
and, from the time they were absent from home, they
"obtained the name of the <i>Long Hunters</i>." This expedition
reached "the country south of the Kentucky river," and became
acquainted with Green river, and the lower part of the Cumberland.</p>

<p>In addition to these parties, so naturally stimulated by the
ardent curiosity incident to early and comparatively, idle society,
the claimants of military bounty lands which had been obtained
from the British crown, for services against the French, furnished
a new and keen band of western explorers. Their land warrants
were surveyed on the Kenhawa and the Ohio; though most
positively against the very letter of the royal proclamation of
'63. But at this distance from the royal court, it was nothing
new in the history of government that edicts emanating, even
from the king in council, should be but imperfectly regarded.
However, this may be, land warrants were actually surveyed on
the Kenhawa as early as 1772, and in 1773, several surveyors were
deputied to lay out bounty lands on the Ohio river.</p>

<p>Amongst others Thomas Bullitt, uncle to the late Alexander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
Scott Bullitt, first lieutenant governor of Kentucky; and Hancock
Taylor, engaged in this adventurous work. These gentlemen
with their company were overtaken on the 28th of May,
1773, by the McAfees, whose exertions will hereafter occupy a
conspicuous station in this narrative.</p>

<p>On the 29th, the party in one boat and four canoes, reached
the Ohio river, and elected Bullitt their captain.</p>

<p>There is a romantic incident connected with this gentleman's
descent of the Ohio, evincing singular intrepidity and presence
of mind; it is taken from his journal, as Mr. [Humphrey] Marshall
says, and the author has found it substantially confirmed
by the McAfee papers. While on his voyage, he left his boat and
went alone through the woods to the Indian town of Old Chillicothe,
on the Scioto. He arrived in the midst of the town undiscovered
by the Indians, until he was waving his white flag as a
token of peace. He was immediately asked what news? Was
he from the Long Knife? And why, if he was a peace-messenger,
he had not sent a runner? Bullitt, undauntedly replied, that
he had no bad news; was from the Long Knife, and as the red
men and the whites were at peace, he had come among his brothers
to have friendly talk with them, about living on the other side of
the Ohio; that he had no runner swifter than himself; and, that
he was in haste and could not wait the return of a runner.
"Would you," said he, "if you were very hungry, and had killed
a deer, send your squaw to town to tell the news, and wait her
return before you eat?" This simple address to their own feelings,
soon put the Indians in good humor, and at his desire a
council was assembled to hear his talk the next day. Captain
Bullitt then made strong assurances of friendship on the part of
the whites and acknowledged that these "Shawanees and Delawares,
our nearest neighbors," "did not get any of the money
or blankets given for the land, which I and my people are going
to settle. But it is agreed by the great men, who own the land,
that they will make a present to both the Delawares and the Shawanees,
the next year; and the year following, that shall be as
good." On the ensuing day, agreeably to the very deliberate
manner of the Indians in council, Captain Bullitt was informed,
that "he seemed kind and friendly, and that it pleased them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
well." That as "to settling the country on the other side of the
Ohio with your people, we are particularly pleased that they are
not to <i>disturb</i> us in our hunting. For we must hunt, to kill meat
for our women and children, and to get something to buy our
powder and lead with, and to get us blankets and clothing." In
these talks, there seems a strange want of the usual sagacity of
the Indians as to the consequences of white men settling on their
hunting grounds; so contrary to their melancholy experience for
a century and a half previous; yet, the narrative is unimpeachable.
On the part of Bullitt, too, the admission of <i>no compensation</i>
to the Delawares and Shawanees, appears to be irreconcilable
with the treaty at Fort Stanwix with the master tribes of the
confederacy, the Six Nations. However, this may be, the parties
separated in perfect harmony, and Captain Bullitt proceeded to
the Falls. Here he pitched his camp above the mouth of Bear-grass
creek, retiring of a night to the upper point of the shoal
above <i>Corn Island</i>, opposite to the present city of Louisville. It
was this gentleman, who, according to the testimony of Jacob
Sodowsky, a respectable farmer, late of Jessamine county, in this
State, first laid off the town of Louisville, in August, 1773. He
likewise surveyed Bullitt's Lick in the adjoining county, of the
same name.</p>

<h2><a name="ZACHARY_TAYLOR" id="ZACHARY_TAYLOR">ZACHARY TAYLOR</a></h2>


<p>Zachary Taylor, twelfth president of the United States,
was a Kentuckian save for his accidental birth near
Orange, Virginia, September 24, 1784. His father, Richard
Taylor, had been planning for many years to remove
to Kentucky, but his vacillation gave Virginia another
president. When but nine months old Zachary Taylor
was brought to Kentucky, the family settling near Louisville.
He "grew up to manhood with the yell of the savage
and the crack of the rifle almost constantly ringing in
his ears." The first twenty-four years of his life were
passed wholly in Kentucky amid all the dangers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
Western wilderness. He was fighting Indians almost
before he could hold a rifle at arm's length, and in such an
environment his education was, of course, very limited.
Taylor entered the army, in 1808, serving in the War of
1812, in Black Hawk's war of 1832, and against the Seminole
Indians (1836-1837). In 1837 he was brevetted brigadier-general.
In 1838 General Taylor was placed in command
of the military stations in Florida; and in 1845 he
took command of the army on the Texas border. The next
five years of General Taylor's life is the history of the
Mexican War. At Palo Alto, Monterey, and at Buena Vista,
on February 22-23, 1847, where he crushed Santa Anna,
he was the absolute man of the hour, the hero of the country.
On the strength of his military renown, General Taylor
was elected as the Whig candidate for president of the
United States, in 1848, defeating General Lewis Cass of
Michigan, and former president, Martin Van Buren, of
New York. He was inaugurated in March, 1849, but he
died at the White House, Washington, July 9, 1850. The
country was torn asunder with many important questions
during Taylor's administration, which, though brief, was
a stormy one. His remains were interred at his old home
near Louisville&mdash;the only president ever buried in this
State&mdash;and a ruined monument marks the grave at this
time. In 1908 a volume of his <i>Letters from the Battlefields
of the Mexican War</i> appeared.</p>

<span>Baton Rouge, La., December 28, 1847.</span><br />
</div>

<p>My dear Sir,&mdash;Your kind and acceptable letter of the 13th
instant, congratulating me on my safe return to the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
States, and for the complimentary and flattering terms you have
been pleased to notice my services, I beg leave to tender you my
sincere thanks.</p>

<p>The warm and hearty reception I have met with from so many
of my fellow-citizens, where I have mingled among them since
my return, in addition to their manifestations of their high appreciation
and approval of my conduct while in Mexico, has been
truly gratifying, and has ten-fold more than compensated me
for the dangers and toils encountered in the public service, as
well as for the privations in being so long separated from my
family and friends; yet there are circumstances connected with
my operations in that country which I can never forget, and
which I must always think of with feelings of the deepest sorrow
and regret.</p>

<p>I left Mexico after it was determined the column under my
orders was to act on the defensive, and after the capital of the
enemy had fallen into our hands, and their army dispersed, on a
short leave of absence, to visit my family, and to attend to some
important private affairs, which could not well be arranged without
my being present, and which had been too long neglected.
After reaching New Orleans, I informed the Secretary of War
that should my presence in Mexico be deemed necessary at any
time, I was ready to return, and that a communication on that
or any other subject connected with my public duties would
reach me if addressed to this place. I therefore feel bound to
remain here, or in the vicinity, until the proper authorities at
Washington determine what disposition is to be made of or with
me. Under this state of things I do not expect to have it in my
power to visit Kentucky, although it would afford me much real
pleasure to mix once more with my numerous relatives and
friends in that patriotic State, to whom I am devotedly attached;
as well as again to visit, if not the place of my nativity, where
I was reared from infancy to early manhood. And let me assure
you I duly appreciate your kind invitation to visit you at your
own hospitable home, and should anything occur which will
enable me to avail myself of it, I will embrace the opportunity
with much real pleasure.</p>

<p>I regret to say, I found my family, or rather Mrs. Taylor, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
my return, in feeble health, as well as my affairs in any other
than a prosperous condition; the latter was, however, to be expected,
and I must devote what time I can spare, or can be spared
from my public duties, in putting them in order as far as I can
do so.</p>

<p>Should circumstances so turn out as will induce you to visit
Washington the present winter, I trust you will take every precaution
to protect yourself while traveling from the effects of the
severe cold weather you must necessarily encounter in crossing
the mountains, particularly so after having passed several of the
last winters in the South.</p>

<p>The letter which you did me the honor to address to me, referred
to, reached me on the eve of my leaving Monterey to return
to the United States, and was at once replied to, which reply
I flatter myself reached you shortly after writing your last communication;
in which I stated, although I had received some letters
from individuals in Kentucky, calculated, or perhaps intended,
to produce unkind feelings on my part toward you, even admitting
such was the case, their object has not been accomplished
in the slightest degree, and I hope it will never be the case.</p>

<p>Please present me mostly kindly to your excellent lady, and
wishing you and yours continued health and prosperity, I remain,
with respect and esteem, etc.</p>

<h2><a name="DANIEL_DRAKE" id="DANIEL_DRAKE">DANIEL DRAKE</a></h2>


<p>Daniel Drake, "the Franklin of the West," was born at
Plainfield, New Jersey, October 20, 1785. When he was
but three years old, his family removed to Mayslick, Mason
county, Kentucky, where they dwelt in a log cabin for
some time. When he was sixteen years of age, Drake
went to Cincinnati to study medicine, the city's first medical
student. He later attended lectures at the medical
school of the University of Pennsylvania. On his return
to Kentucky, Dr. Drake practiced his profession near his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
home at Mayslick, Kentucky, but he shortly afterwards
went to Cincinnati, where he became a distinguished physician
and author. In 1816 he was appointed professor of
materia medica and botany in the medical school of Transylvania
University, and he held this chair for one year.
He returned to Transylvania, in 1823, and this time he
remained for four years. In 1835 Dr. Drake organized
the medical department of Cincinnati College. Four
years later he went to Louisville to accept the chair of
clinical medicine and pathological anatomy in the University
of Louisville, which he occupied for ten years. He
returned to Cincinnati two years before his death, which
occurred there, November 6, 1852. Dr. Drake's publications
include <i>Topography, Climate, and Diseases of Cincinnati</i>
(1810); <i>Picture of Cincinnati</i> (Cincinnati, 1815);
<i>Practical Essays on Medical Education</i> (1832); <i>Systematic
Treatise on the Principal Diseases of the Interior
Valley of North America</i> (Philadelphia, 1850; 1852), a
work which was characterized by Judge James Hall of
Cincinnati as "the most important and valuable work
ever written in the United States. The subject is large.
The work could not be compiled. The subject was new,
and the materials were to be collected from original
sources, from observation, personal inspection, oral evidence,
etc. It occupied many years; and was, probably,
in contemplation during the whole or most part of Dr.
Drake's long professional life." To-day Dr. Drake's
most popular work is <i>Pioneer Life in Kentucky</i>, a series
of reminiscential letters addressed to his children, concerning
early times in Kentucky. It was issued by Robert
Clarke, the Cincinnati publisher in his well-known
Ohio Valley Historical Series. This is a charming volume
and it has been much quoted and praised by Western
writers.</p>

<p class="center">MAYSLICK, KENTUCKY, IN 1800</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>Pioneer Life in Kentucky</i> (Cincinnati, 1870)]</p>

<p>Mayslick, although scarcely a village, was at once an emporium
and capital for a tract of country six or eight miles in diameter,
and embracing several hundred families, of which those
in father's neighborhood were tolerably fair specimens. Uncle
Abraham Drake kept a store, and Shotwell and Morris kept
taverns; besides them there were a few poor mechanics. Uncle
Cornelius Drake was a farmer merely, and lived a little out of
the center of the station; the great men of which were the three
I have just named. With this limited population, it seems, even
down to this time, wonderful to me that such gatherings and such
scenes should have been transacted there. They commenced
within five years after its settlement, and increasing with the
progress of surrounding population, continued in full vigor long
after I left home for Cincinnati. It was the place for holding
regimental militia musters, when all the boys and old men of
the surrounding country, not less than those who stood enrolled,
would assemble; and before dispersing at night, the training was
quite eclipsed by a heterogeneous drama of foot racing, pony
racing, wrestling, fighting, drunkenness and general uproar. It
was also a place for political meetings and stump conflict by opposing
candidates, and after intellectual performances there
generally followed an epilogue of oaths, yells, loud blows, and
gnashing of teeth. Singing-schools were likewise held at the
same place in a room of Deacon Morris's tavern. I was never a
scholar, which I regret, for it has always been a grief with me
that I did not learn music in early life. I occasionally attended.
As in all country singing-schools, sacred music only was taught,
but in general there was not much display of sanctity. I have a
distinct remembrance of one teacher only. He was a Yankee,
without a family, between forty and fifty years of age, and wore
a matted mass of thick hair over the place where men's ears are
usually found. Thus protected, his were never seen, and after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
the opinion spread abroad that by some misfortune they had been
cut off, he "cut and run."</p>

<p>The infant capital was, still further, the local seat of justice;
and Saturday was for many years, at all times I might say, the
regular term time. Instead of trying cases at home, two or three
justices of the peace would come to the Lick on that day, and
hold their separate courts. This, of course, brought thither all
the litigants of the neighborhood with their friends and witnesses;
all who wished to purchase at the store would postpone their
visit to the same day; all who had to replenish their jugs of
whiskey did the same thing; all who had business with others
expected to meet them there, as our city merchants, at noon, expect
to meet each other on 'change; finally, all who thirsted
after drink, fun, frolic, or fighting, of course, were present. Thus
Saturday was a day of largely suspended field labor, but devoted
to public business, social pleasure, dissipation, and beastly drunkenness.
You might suppose that the presence of civil magistrates
would have repressed some of these vices, but it was not so. Each
day provided a bill of fare for the next. A new trade in horses,
another horse race, a cock-fight, or a dog-fight, a wrestling
match, or a pitched battle between two bullies, who in fierce encounter
would lie on the ground scratching, pulling hair, choking,
gouging out each other's eyes, and biting off each other's noses,
in the manner of bull-dogs, while a Roman circle of interested
lookers-on would encourage the respective gladiators with shouts
which a passing demon might have mistaken for those of hell.
In the afternoon, the men and boys of business and sobriety would
depart, and at nightfall the dissipated would follow them, often
two on a horse, reeling and yelling as I saw drunken Indians do
in the neighborhood of Fort Leavenworth, in the summer of
1844. But many would be too much intoxicated to mount their
horses, and must therefore remain till Sunday morning.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="MARY_A_HOLLEY" id="MARY_A_HOLLEY">MARY A. HOLLEY</a></h2>


<p>Mrs. Mary Austin Holley, the historian of Texas, was
born at New Haven, Connecticut, in 1786. On January
1, 1805, she was married to the Rev. Horace Holley, who,
in the fall of that year, became pastor of a church at
Greenfield Hill, Connecticut. Mrs. Holley, of course, was
in Boston with her husband from 1809 to 1818; and she
accompanied him to Lexington, Kentucky, when he accepted
the presidency of Transylvania University. Mrs.
Holley was one of the few persons whom the eccentric
scientist, Rafinesque, set down as having been very kind
to him while he was connected with the University. She
lived in Lexington until the spring of 1827, when she went
with her husband to New Orleans. She wrote a poem,
<i>On Leaving Kentucky</i>, the first stanza of which is as follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Farewell to the land in which broad rivers flow,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And vast prairies bloom as in Eden's young day!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Farewell to the land in which lofty trees grow,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the vine and the mistletoe's empire display.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She later embarked with her husband for New York,
and it was her pen that so vividly described his death on
shipboard. After Dr. Holley's death his widow returned
to Lexington, Kentucky, and wrote the memoir for Dr.
Charles Caldwell's <i>Discourse on the Genius and Character
of the Rev. Horace Holley, LL. D.</i> (Boston, 1828). Mrs.
Holley left Kentucky in 1831 and emigrated to Texas under
the protection of her celebrated kinsman, General
Stephen Fuller Austin, a Transylvania University man,
and the founder of Texas. Her <i>Texas</i> (Lexington, Kentucky,
1836), was one of the first histories of that country
ever published. Mrs. Holley was a widely read woman,
theology being her favorite study, and, like her husband,
she was a Unitarian. In person she was said to be a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
charming woman. Mrs. Holley spent the last several
years of her life at New Orleans, in which city she died
on August 2, 1846.</p>

<p class="center">TEXAS WOMEN</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>Texas</i> (Lexington, Kentucky, 1836)]</p>

<p>Living in a wild country under circumstances requiring constant
exertion, forms the character to great and daring enterprise.
Women thus situated are known to perform exploits,
which the effeminate men of populous cities might tremble at.
Hence there are more Dianas and <i>Esther Stanhopes</i> than one in
Texas. It is not uncommon for ladies to mount their mustangs
and hunt with their husbands, and with them to camp out for
days on their excursions to the sea shore for fish and oysters.
All visiting is done on horseback, and they will go fifty miles to
a ball with their silk dresses, made perhaps in Philadelphia or
New Orleans, in their saddle-bags. Hardy, vigorous constitutions,
free spirits, and spontaneous gaiety are thus induced, and
continued a rich legacy to their children, who, it is to be hoped,
will sufficiently value the blessing not to squander it away, in their
eager search for the luxuries and refinements of polite life.
Women have capacity for greatness, but they require occasions
to bring it out. They require, perhaps, stronger motives than
men&mdash;they have stronger barriers to break through of indolence
and habit&mdash;but, when roused, they are quick to discern and unshrinking
to act. <i>Lot was unfortunate in his wife.</i> Many a wife
in Texas has proved herself the better half, and many a widow's
heart has prompted her to noble daring.</p>

<p>Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; left her home in Kentucky with her six sons, and
<i>no other jewels</i>. There was good land and room in Texas. Hither
she came with the first settlers, at a time when the Indians were
often troublesome by coming in large companies and encamping
near an isolated farm, demanding of its helpless proprietors, not
then too well provided for, whatever of provisions or other things
struck their fancies. One of these <i>foraging</i> parties, not over nice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
in their demands, stationed themselves in rather too near proximity
to the dwelling of this veteran lady. They were so well satisfied
with their position, and scoured the place so completely, that
she ventured to remonstrate, gently at first, then more vehemently.
All would not do: the <i>pic-nics</i> would not budge an inch;
and moreover threatened life if she did not forbear from further
expressions of impatience. The good woman was <i>armed</i>. She
buckled on her <i>breastplate</i> of <i>courage</i>, if not of <i>righteousness</i>, and
with her children and women servants, all her household around
her, sent for the chief, and very boldly expostulating with him,
<i>commanded</i> him to depart on the instant at the peril of his tribe;
or by a signal she would call in her whole <i>people</i>, numerous and
formidable, and exterminate his race. She was no more troubled
with the Indians. She lives comfortably with her thriving family
and thriving fortune, and with great credit to herself, on the
road between Brazoria and San Felipe, in the same house now
famed for its hospitality and comfort. It is the usual stopping
place for travellers on that route, who are not a little entertained
with the border stories and characteristic jests there related, by
casual companies meeting for the night and sharing the same
apartment. It was thus that the above incident, much more exemplified,
was drawn from the hostess herself. A volume of
<i>reminiscences</i> thus collected, racy with the marvellous, would not
be <i>unapt</i> to modern taste, and the modern science of book-making.</p>

<h2><a name="JOHN_J_CRITTENDEN" id="JOHN_J_CRITTENDEN">JOHN J. CRITTENDEN</a></h2>


<p>John Jordan Crittenden, a Kentucky statesman and orator
of national reputation, was born near Versailles, Kentucky,
September 10, 1787. He was graduated from the
College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia,
studied law, and was admitted to the Frankfort bar. Crittenden
served in the War of 1812; and in 1816 he was a
member of the Kentucky legislature. In the following
year he was elected United States Senator from Kentucky,
his party, the Whig, then being in power in this State.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
From 1827 to 1829 Crittenden was United States Attorney
for the district of Kentucky; and in 1835 he was again
sent to the Senate, with Henry Clay as his colleague.
President William Henry Harrison made him his Attorney-General,
in 1841, and he resigned his seat in the Senate.
When John Tyler succeeded to the presidency six
months later, on the death of Harrison, Crittenden withdrew
from the cabinet portfolio, and he was almost immediately
returned to the Senate by the legislature of
Kentucky. He served until 1848, when he was elected
Governor of Kentucky. Governor Crittenden was the
most distinguished, if not indeed the ablest, chief executive
this Commonwealth has ever known. He resigned
the governorship, in 1850, in order to become President
Fillmore's Attorney-General, which position he held for
three years. In 1855 Crittenden was for the fourth time
elected United States Senator from Kentucky. As the
war between the States approached, Senator Crittenden,
though a Southerner, chose the cause of the Union, lining
up with the administration heart and soul. In the beginning
he did his utmost to prevent the war, and, failing,
he exerted his entire energies to aid Abraham Lincoln
and the North to prosecute it. In 1860 the Senator urged
his famous Compromise, providing for the restablishment
of the old slave-line of 36' 30 N., and for the enforcement
of the fugitive-slave laws, but it was never moulded
into law. The last two years of his life were spent as a
member of the lower House of Congress, where he continued
his fight for the supremacy of the Constitution.
Senator Crittenden died near Frankfort, Kentucky, July
26, 1863, thus surviving his greatest friend and fellow
patriot, Henry Clay, more than eleven years.</p>

<p class="center">EULOGY UPON ASSOCIATE JUSTICE McKINLEY</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>The Life of John J. Crittenden</i>, edited by his daughter, Mrs. Chapman
Coleman (Philadelphia, 1871)]</p>

<p>At the opening of the court this morning, Mr. Crittenden, the
Attorney-General of the United States, addressed the court as
follows:</p>

<p>"Since its adjournment yesterday, the members of the bar and
officers of the court held a meeting and adopted resolutions expressive
of their high sense of the public and private worth of the
Hon. John McKinley, one of the justices of this court, and their
deep regret at his death. By the same meeting I was requested
to present those resolutions to the court, and to ask that they
might be entered on its records, and I now rise to perform that
honored task.</p>

<p>"Besides the private grief which naturally attends it, the
death of a member of this court, which is the head of the great,
essential, and vital department of the government, must always
be an event of public interest and importance.</p>

<p>"I had the good fortune to be acquainted with Judge McKinley
from my earliest manhood. In the relations of private life he
was frank, hospitable, affectionate. In his manners he was simple
and unaffected, and his character was uniformly marked with
manliness, integrity, and honor. Elevation to the bench of the
Supreme Court made no change in him. His honors were borne
meekly, without ostentation or presumption.</p>

<p>"He was a candid, impartial, and righteous judge. Shrinking
from no responsibility, he was fearless in the performance of his
duty, seeking only to do right, and fearing nothing but to do
wrong. Death has now set her seal to his character, making it
unchangeable forever; and I think it may be truly inscribed on
his monument that as a private gentleman and as a public magistrate
he was without fear and without reproach.</p>

<p>"This occasion cannot but remind us of other afflicting losses
which have recently befallen us. The present, indeed, has been
a sad year for the profession of the law. In a few short months
it has been bereaved of its brightest and greatest ornaments.
Clay, Webster, and Sergeant have gone to their immortal rest in
quick succession. We had scarcely returned from the grave of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
one of them till we were summoned to the funeral of another.
Like bright stars they have sunk below the horizon, and have left
the land in widespread gloom. This hall that knew them so
well shall know them no more. Their wisdom has no utterance
now, and the voice of their eloquence shall be heard here no more
forever.</p>

<p>"This hall itself seems as though it was sensible of its loss, and
even these marble pillars seem to sympathize as they stand around
us like so many majestic mourners.</p>

<p>"But we will have consolation in the remembrance of these illustrious
men. Their <i>names</i> will remain to us and be like a light
kindled in the sky to shine upon us and to guide our course. We
may hope, too, that the memory of them and their great examples
will create a virtuous emulation which may raise up men worthy
to be their successors in the service of their country, its constitution,
and its laws.</p>

<p>"For this digression, and these allusions to Clay, Webster, and
Sergeant, I hope the occasion may be considered as a sufficient excuse,
and I will not trespass by another word, except only to move
that these resolutions in relation to Judge McKinley, when they
shall have been read by the clerk, may be entered on the records
of this court."</p>

<h2><a name="JOHN_M_HARNEY" id="JOHN_M_HARNEY">JOHN M. HARNEY</a></h2>


<p>John Milton Harney, the first of the Kentucky poets to
win and retain a wide reputation, a man with the divine
afflatus, whose whole body of song is slender but of real
worth, was born near Georgetown, Delaware, March 9,
1789. He was the second son of Major Thomas Harney,
of Revolutionary War fame, and the elder brother of
General William S. Harney, a hero of Cerro Gordo. When
John Milton Harney was but two years old, his family
emigrated to Tennessee, and later removed to Louisiana.
He studied medicine and settled at Bardstown, Kentucky.
In 1814 Dr. Harney married a daughter of Judge John
Rowan, the early Kentucky statesman; and her death four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
years later was such a shock to her husband that he was
compelled to abandon his practice, and seek solace in
travel and new scenes. Dr. Harney spent some time in
England, and on his return to America he settled at Savannah,
Georgia. He over-exerted himself at a disastrous
fire in Savannah, which resulted in a violent fever and
ended in breaking his health. He returned to Bardstown,
Kentucky, became a convert to Roman Catholicism, and
in that place he died, January 15, 1825, when but thirty-five
years of age. At the age of twenty-three years, Dr.
Harney wrote <i>Crystalina, a Fairy Tale</i>, in six cantos, but
his extreme sensitiveness caused him to hold it in manuscript
for four years, or until 1816, when it was issued
anonymously at New York. This work was highly praised
by Rufus W. Griswold, John Neal, and other well-known
critics, but the unfavorable criticism far outweighed the
favorable criticism, so the author held, and he published
nothing more in book form; and he did all in his power to
suppress the edition of <i>Crystalina</i>. William Davis Gallagher,
poet and critic of a later time in the West, went
over Dr. Harney's manuscripts and from them rescued
his masterpiece, the exquisite <i>Echo and the Lover</i>. This
Gallagher published in his <i>Western Literary Journal</i> for
1837&mdash;the first form in which the public saw it. No
Western poem has had a wider audience than the <i>Echo</i>.
It has been parodied in Europe and America many times,
and is the finest expression of Dr. Harney's genius. It
is to be regretted that no comprehensive account of the
poet's life and literary labors has come down to posterity.
As a poet and as a man his merits were of the truest sort,
but a handful of facts, a suppressed book, a lyric or so, are
all that have been brought to the attention of the literary
world.</p>

<h2><a name="GEORGE_ROBERTSON" id="GEORGE_ROBERTSON">GEORGE ROBERTSON</a></h2>


<p>George Robertson, the most widely quoted Kentucky
jurist, and an able writer, was born near Harrodsburg,
Kentucky, November 18, 1790. He was educated in the
arts and in law at Transylvania University, and entered
upon the practice of his profession at Lancaster, Kentucky,
in 1809. In 1816 Robertson was elected to Congress,
where he remained for two terms. He drew up the
bill for the establishment of Arkansaw territory; and he
projected the system of cutting public lands into small
lots, selling them to actual settlers for one dollar and
twenty-five cents per acre. He declined another term in
the House, as well as the attorney-generalship of Kentucky,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
in order to devote his whole attention to the law.
Robertson was elected against his desire to the Kentucky
legislature, in 1822, and he was a member of that body for
the next five years. This was the time of the struggle
between the Old-Court and New-Court parties, which was
one of the most bitter political fights ever seen in Kentucky.
Robertson consistently and vigorously championed
the cause of the Old-Court party, which finally won.
That this disgusted him with political life in any dress, is
shown by his subsequent declination of the governorship
of Arkansaw, and the Columbian and Peruvian missions.
In 1828 he was elected an associate justice of the Kentucky
Court of Appeals, and, in the following year, chief
justice. This position was George Robertson's heart's
desire&mdash;he hated politics with a never-dying hatred, the
law and the bench being his earthly paradise. He was
chief justice of Kentucky for fourteen years, when he resigned
to return to the active practice of law. From 1834
to 1857 Judge Robertson was professor of law in Transylvania
University at Lexington. He died at Lexington,
May 16, 1874, generally regarded as the ablest jurist Kentucky
has produced. He was also the author of four
books: <i>Introductory Lecture to the Transylvania Law
Class</i> (Lexington); <i>Biographical Sketch of John Boyle</i>
(Frankfort, 1838); <i>Scrap-Book on Law and Politics, Men
and Times</i> (Lexington, 1855), his best known book; and
his very interesting and well-written autobiography, entitled
<i>An Outline of the Life of George Robertson, written
by Himself</i> (Lexington, 1876), to which his son contributed
an introduction and appendix.</p>

<p class="center">EARLY STRUGGLES</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>An Outline of the Life of George Robertson, written by Himself</i>
(Lexington, Kentucky, 1876)]</p>

<p>Yet, thus juvenile, poor, and proud, I ventured not only on the
rather hopeless prospects of professional life, but, on the 28th of
November, 1809, when I was only ten days over nineteen years of
age, I ventured on the far more momentous contingencies of marriage,
and, linking my destinies with a wife only fifteen years and
seven months old, we embarked without freight or pilotage, on the
untried sea of early marriage. I had never made a cent, and had
nothing but ordinary clothes, a horse, an old servant, a few books,
and the humble talents with which God had blessed me. I borrowed
thirteen dollars as an outfit, and out of that fund I paid
for my license and handed to my groomsman, R. P. Letcher, five
dollars for paying the parson, Randolph Hall, father of Rev.
Nathan H. Hall. Some days afterwards Letcher rather slyly
put into my hand a dollar, suggesting that he had saved that
much for me by paying the preacher only four dollars. This
looked to me as such minute parsimony as to excite my indignation,
important as was only one dollar then to me. And I manifested
that feeling in a manner both emphatic and censurious; to
which Letcher replied that four dollars was more than was then
customary, and that Mr. Hall, when he received it, expressed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
warmest gratitude, and said that, old as he was, he had never received
so large a fee for solemnizing the matrimonial rite! This
reconciled me to the return of the dollar.</p>

<p>My wife and myself lived with her mother until the 9th of
September, 1810, when we set up for ourselves in a small buckeye
house with only two rooms, built and first occupied by Judge
[John] Boyle, and respecting which I may here suggest this remarkable
coincidence of successive events:&mdash;That Boyle commenced
housekeeping in that house, and, while he occupied it,
was elected to Congress; that Samuel McKee commenced housekeeping
in the same house, and succeeded Boyle in Congress; that
I commenced housekeeping in the same house, and succeeded
McKee in Congress; and that R. P. Letcher commenced housekeeping
in the same house, and, after an interval of two years,
succeeded me in Congress. I was unable to furnish it with a carpet,
and our only furniture consisted of two beds, one table, one
bureau, six split-bottomed chairs, and a small supply of table and
kitchen furniture, which I bought with a small gold watch. I
had bought a bag of flour, a bag of corn meal, a half barrel of salt,
and two hams and two middlings of bacon; and these, together
with the milk of a small cow given to my wife by her mother, and
a few chickens and some butter, constituted our entire outfit of
provisions. But all our supplies were stolen the night we commenced
housekeeping. This was, at that time, a heavy blow. I
had no money; and, though I had good credit, I resolved not to
buy anything on credit. And that was one of the best resolutions
I ever made. It stimulated my industry and economy, and
soon secured to me peace and a comfortable sense of independence.
In adhering to my privative, but conservative resolve, I often cut
and carried on my shoulders wood from a neighboring forest.</p>


<p class="center">LITERARY FAME</p>

<p class="center">[From the same]</p>

<p>The classical reader remembers that, when almost all the
Greeks, captured with Nicias at Syracuse, had died in dungeons,
a remnant of the survivors saved themselves by the recitation of
beautiful extracts from Euripides. How potent was the shadowed
genius of the immortal Athenian, when it alone melted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
icy hearts that nothing else could touch, and broke the captive's
chains, which justice, and prayers, and tears, had in vain tried to
unloose! And hence "the glory of Euripides had all Greece for
a monument." He too was elevated by the light of other minds.
It is said that he acquired a sublime inspiration whenever he read
Homer&mdash;whose Iliad and whose Odyssey&mdash;the one exhibiting
the fatality of strife among leading men, the other portraying the
efficacy of perseverance&mdash;have stamped his name on the roll of
fame in letters of sunshine, that will never fade away. No
memorial tells where Troy once stood&mdash;Delphi is now mute&mdash;the
thunder of Olympus is hushed, and Apollo's lyre no longer
echoes along the banks of the Peneus&mdash;but the fame of Homer
still travels with the stars.</p>

<h2><a name="SHADRACH_PENN" id="SHADRACH_PENN">SHADRACH PENN</a></h2>


<p>Shadrach Penn, one of the ablest of Kentucky journalists,
was born at Frederick, Maryland, in 1790. His
family settled near Georgetown, Kentucky, when he was a
mere boy. Penn began his newspaper career at Georgetown
when he was but nineteen years of age; and he subsequently
served in the War of 1812. In 1818 Penn removed
to Louisville and established <i>The Public Advertiser</i>,
which was a weekly for the first few years of its
history, then a semi-weekly, and, on April 4, 1826, a final
change was made "and the first daily newspaper west of
the Alleghanies was flung to the public." After the establishment
of the <i>Kentucky Gazette</i>, this marked the second
most epoch-making event in Kentucky journalism.
Penn was an able editor, the very ablest in Kentucky, and
he was having things his own way in the West, advocating
Jacksonian Democracy. In 1828 President Jackson
showed his appreciation of Penn's services by offering
him a place in his cabinet, which he declined, but he did
spend a winter at Washington as the President's warm
friend and adviser. Then, <i>mirabile dictu!</i> the Whigs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
brought George D. Prentice to Kentucky and, in 1830, he
established the <i>Louisville Journal</i>, and began a most bitter
fight upon Penn's paper. Penn fought back as best he
could, but he was quite unequal for the contest. For
nearly twelve years the warfare was waged without either
editor asking quarter, and to the infinite amusement of
the whole country. In 1841 Penn ran up the white flag
and went to St. Louis to become editor of the <i>St. Louis
Reporter</i>. Prentice bade him farewell in the best of temper,
and when he died at St. Louis, on June 15, 1846, the
old Whig's tribute to his memory was the finest one written.</p>

<p class="center">THE COMING OF GEORGE D. PRENTICE</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>The Public Advertiser</i> (Louisville, September 10, 1830)]</p>

<p>This gentleman and Mr. Buxton, of Cincinnati, have issued
proposals for publishing a daily paper in Louisville, which is to
be edited by Mr. Prentice. Willing that the gentleman shall be
known by the people whose patronage he is seeking, we copy today
from a Cincinnati paper his account of the late elections in
Kentucky. The production may be viewed as a fair specimen
of his "fine literature, his drollery, strong powers of sarcasm,"
and, above all, his "poetical capacity." The respect and
attachment he displays toward Kentucky (to say nothing of the
Jackson party), must be exquisitely gratifying to the respectable
portion of Mr. Clay's friends in this city. To them we commend
the letter of Mr. Prentice as an erudite, chaste, and veritable production,
worthy of the "great editor" who is hereafter to figure
as Mr. Clay's champion in the West. We may, moreover, congratulate
them in consequence of the fair prospect before them;
for with the aid of such an editor they cannot fail to effect miraculous
revolutions or revulsions in the political world. The occupants
of all our fish markets will be confirmed in their devotion to
the opposition beyond redemption.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="WILLIAM_O_BUTLER" id="WILLIAM_O_BUTLER">WILLIAM O. BUTLER</a></h2>


<p>William Orlando Butler, one of General Lew Wallace's
favorite poets, was born near Nicholasville, Kentucky, in
1791. He was the son of Percival Butler, a noted Revolutionary
soldier. He was graduated from Transylvania
University, Lexington, in 1812. Butler studied law for a
short time, but the War of 1812 called him and he enlisted.
At the River Raisin he was wounded and captured and
carried through Canada to Fort Niagara, but he was later
exchanged. Butler was with General Jackson at the battle
of New Orleans, and his gallantry attracted the attention
of the general, who placed him upon his staff. In
1817 Butler returned to the law, married, and settled in
the little river town of Carrollton, Kentucky, on the Ohio,
his home henceforth. In July, 1821, the first draft of his
famous poem, <i>The Boatman's Horn</i> (then called <i>The Boat
Horn</i>), was published in <i>The Western Review</i>, a monthly
magazine of Lexington, Kentucky. In describing his boyhood
days at Covington, Indiana, General Lew Wallace
very charmingly writes of his early love for the Wabash
river, and for old Nebeker, the lonesome ferryman, who
"welcomed me for my company. On the farther side,
chained to a tree, he kept a long tin horn. A traveller,
coming to the bank and finding us on the townward side,
blew to get our attention ... when the voice of the
big horn on the thither side called to us&mdash;How it startled
me! What music there was in it! What haste I made to
unship my oar!... And if since then I have been an
ardent fisherman, believing with my friend Maurice
Thompson that</p>

<p>is still a favorite of mine, with power to stir my pulses
and return me to a freak of childhood full of joyousness
alloyed only with thought of my mother's fears, the
shrewd reader will know at once how such tastes inured
to me. And as swimming seems to have been one of my
natural accomplishments, I must have acquired it during
my days at the ferry." This is far and away the best
background for Butler's poem that has been done, and
with it before the reader the famous poem must mean
more to him. The poem was subsequently published as
the title-poem in a small collection of his verse, entitled
<i>The Boatman's Horn and Other Poems</i>. From 1839 to
1843 Butler was a Kentucky Congressman; and in 1844
the unsuccessful candidate for governor of Kentucky.
Upon his Mexican War record, General Butler was nominated
by the Democratic party for vice-president of the
United States with General Lewis Cass, of Michigan, as
the head of the ticket, but they were defeated by Martin
Van Buren and Charles Francis Adams. In 1855 General
Butler declined the governorship of the territory of Nebraska;
and in 1861 he went to Washington as a member
of the famous "Peace Congress." General Butler died
at his home, Carrollton, Kentucky, August 6, 1880, in the
ninetieth year of his age. Though famous as a soldier
and politician, <i>The Boatman's Horn</i> is the work that will
keep his name green for many years; and several of his
other poems are not to be utterly despised.</p>

<h2><a name="HEW_AINSLIE" id="HEW_AINSLIE">HEW AINSLIE</a></h2>


<p>Hew Ainslie, the foremost Scottish-Kentucky poet, was
born at Bargery Mains, Ayrshire, April 5, 1792. Ill-health
cut short Ainslie's education at the Ayr Academy,
but some years later he went up to Glasgow to study law.
Law and Hew Ainslie were not congenial fellows, and he
shortly embarked upon the art of landscape gardening.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
He was next a clerk in Edinburgh, and also amanuensis
for Professor Dugald Stewart. "Gradually the clouds
of [Ainslie's] tobacco smoke began to curl into seven letters
which looked like America." He was thirty years
of age when he arrived at New York. He spent his first
years in New York and Indiana as a farmer, but he soon
relinquished this work and went, in 1829, to Louisville,
Kentucky, where, three years later, an Ohio river flood
swept his property away. And two years after this disastrous
flood, fire destroyed his property in Indiana. Undismayed
by misfortune, Ainslie became a contractor and
supervised the erection of many large business structures
in Louisville and other cities. During all these years he
was assiduously courting the Muse, and making a great
reputation for himself as a poet. Ainslie's first book, <i>A
Pilgrimage to the Land of Burns</i> (Deptford, 1822), is the
English edition of his charming lyrics; and his <i>Scottish
Songs, Ballads, and Poems</i> (New York, 1855), is the only
American edition of his work. In 1864, forty-two years
after his departure, Ainslie revisited the land of his birth,
where he was hailed as one of Scotland's finest singers
since Robert Burns. Kentucky was in the poet's blood,
however, and a year later he returned to his home at Louisville.
His American friends were not to be outdone by
his home people, and they arranged a great home-coming
for him. In 1871, when the Scots of Louisville assembled
to celebrate the birthday of Burns, Ainslie, the toastmaster,
arose and smilingly confessed to having once kissed
"Bonnie Jean," Burns's widow. He died at Louisville,
March 11, 1878. A comprehensive Scottish edition of his
<i>A Pilgrimage to the Land of Burns, and Poems</i>, was
issued in 1892. <i>The Ingle Side</i>, a little song of sixteen
lines, is Ainslie's masterpiece; but it was as a poet of the
sea that he won his great reputation. "As Lloyd Mifflin
is America's greatest sonneteer, so Hew Ainslie, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
adopted Kentuckian, may perhaps be ranked as America's
most ardent singer of the sea."</p>

<h2><a name="JAMES_G_BIRNEY" id="JAMES_G_BIRNEY">JAMES G. BIRNEY</a></h2>


<p>James Gillespie Birney, leader of the Conservative Abolitionists,
opposed to the radicalism of William Lloyd Garrison
and all his ilk, yet as earnest and sincere in his
hatred of slavery, was born at Danville, Kentucky, February
4, 1792. He was at Transylvania University for a
short time, then proceeded to Princeton, from which institution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
he was graduated in 1810. In 1814 he became a
lawyer in his native town of Danville. In 1816 Birney
was in the Kentucky legislature; but two years later he
removed to Alabama, settling upon a plantation near
Huntsville. The slavery question was appealing to him
more and more, and he finally became an agent for the
American Colonization Society. In the fall of 1833 Birney
returned to Kentucky, and went to Danville, where
he freed his own slaves, and organized the Kentucky Anti-Slavery
Society. On January 1, 1836, the first issue of
his anti-slavery sheet, <i>The Philanthropist</i>, appeared from
his Cincinnati office. This soon became the Bible of the
Conservative Abolitionists, who opposed the drastic methods
of Garrison and his followers. In his speeches Birney
denounced all violence and fanaticism in the handling of
the slavery problem, though he himself received much
violence at the hands of mobs and almost insane partisans.
His strong addresses through the North won him the
secretaryship of the American Anti-Slavery Society in
1837. In this capacity he was soon recognized as the real
leader of the "Constitutional Abolitionists," who said
they stood upon the Constitution, fought against secession,
and desired to wipe slavery from the face of the American
continent with decency and in order. In 1840 and again
in 1844 Birney was the candidate of the Liberty party for
president of the United States. In the second campaign
he multiplied his very small vote received in the first race
by nine. He was thrown from his horse, in 1845, and the
final twelve years of his life were passed as an invalid.
Birney died at Perth Amboy, New Jersey, November 25,
1857. Besides numerous contributions to the press, his
principal writings are <i>Letter on Colonization</i> (1834); <i>Addresses
and Speeches</i> (1835); <i>American Churches the
Bulwarks of American Slavery</i> (1840); <i>Speeches in England</i>(1840);
and <i>An Examination of the Decision of the</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>

<p class="center">THE NO-GOVERNMENT DOCTRINES</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>A Letter on the Political Obligations of Abolitionists</i> (Boston, 1839)]</p>

<p>Within the last twelve or eighteen months, it is believed&mdash;after
efforts, some successful, some not, had been begun to affect
the elections&mdash;and whilst the most indefatigable exertions were
being made by many of our influential, intelligent and liberal
friends to convince the great body of the abolitionists of the necessity&mdash;the
indispensable necessity&mdash;of breaking away from
their old "<i>parties</i>," and uniting together in the use of the elective
franchise for the advancement of the cause of human freedom in
which we were engaged;&mdash;at this very time, and mainly, too, in
that part of the country where <i>political action</i> had been most successful,
and whence, from its promise of soon being wholly triumphant,
great encouragement was derived by abolitionists everywhere,
a sect has arisen in our midst, whose members regard it as
of religious obligation, in no case, <i>to exercise the elective franchise</i>.
This persuasion is part and parcel of the tenet which it
is believed they have embraced&mdash;that as Christians have the
precepts of the Gospel to direct, and the Spirit of God to guide
them, all human governments, as necessarily including the idea
of <i>force to secure obedience</i>, are not only superfluous, but unlawful
encroachments on the Divine government, as ascertained
from the sources above mentioned. Therefore, they refuse to do
anything voluntarily, by which they would be considered as
acknowledging the lawful existence of human governments. Denying
to civil governments the right to use force, they easily deduce
that family governments have no such right. Thus they
would withhold from parents any power of personal chastisement
or restraint for the correction of their children. They carry out
to the full extent the "non-resistance" theory. To the first ruffian
who would demand our purse, or oust us from our houses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
they are to be unconditionally surrendered, unless <i>moral suasion</i>
be found sufficient to induce him to decline from his purpose.
Our wives, our daughters, our sisters&mdash;our mothers we are to
see set upon by the most brutal, without any effort on our part,
except argument, to defend them&mdash;and even they themselves are
forbidden to use in defense of their purity such powers as God
has endowed them with for its protection, if resistance should be
attended with any injury or destruction to the assailant. In
short, the "No-Government" doctrines, as they are believed now
to be embraced, seem to strike at the root of the social structure;
and tend&mdash;so far as I am able to judge of their tendency&mdash;to
throw society into entire confusion, and to renew, under the sanction
of religion, scenes of anarchy and license that have generally
heretofore been the offspring of the rankest infidelity and irreligion.</p>

<p>It is but justice to say&mdash;judging from the moral deportment
of the adherents of the "No-Government" scheme&mdash;that so far
from admitting, what I have supposed to be, its legitimate consequences,
they would wholly deny and repudiate them.</p>

<p>These Sectaries have not as yet separated themselves from
the American [Anti-Slavery] society. Far from it. They insist
that their views are altogether harmonious with what is required
for membership by the constitution.... But is this
really so? Is the difference between those who seek to abolish
any and every government of human institution, and those who
prefer <i>any</i> government to a state of things in which every one
may do what seemeth good in his own eyes&mdash;is the difference
between them, I say, so small that they can act harmoniously
under the same organization? When, in obedience to the principles
of the society, I go to the polls and there call on my neighbors
to unite with me in electing to Congress men who are in favor
of Human Rights, I am met by a No-Government abolitionist inculcating
on them the doctrine that Congress has <i>no rightful
authority</i> to act at all in the premises&mdash;how can we proceed together?
When I am animating my fellow-citizens to aid men in
infusing into the government salutary influences which shall put
an end to all oppression&mdash;my No-Government brother cries out
at the top of his lungs, <i>all</i> governments are of the Devil(!) where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
is our harmony! Our efficiency? We are in the condition of the
two physicians called in to the same patient&mdash;one of whom
should be intent on applying the proper remedies for expelling
the disease from the body and thus restoring and purifying its
functions; the other equally intent on utterly destroying body,
members, functions and all. Could they be agreed, and could
they walk together? It seems to me not. And simply because
their aim, their objects are radically and essentially different.
So with the No-Government and the Pro-Government abolitionists.
One party is for sustaining and purifying governments,
and bringing them to a perfect conformity with the principles of
the Divine government&mdash;the other for destroying <i>all</i> government.</p>

<h2><a name="THOMAS_CORWIN" id="THOMAS_CORWIN">THOMAS CORWIN</a></h2>


<p>Thomas Corwin, witty, delightful "Tom" Corwin, was
born near Paris, Kentucky, July 29, 1794. Before he was
five years old, his father had taken him into the wilds of
Ohio, the Lebanon of today. "Tom" Corwin was admitted
to the bar, in 1818, after a slender education and a
brief reading of the law. His wit and eloquence made his
reputation rapidly and, in 1830, he found himself in the
lower House of Congress. The whole country laughed
at his inimitable speeches; and that he had a strong hold
on the Ohio Whigs is certain as they returned him to the
House for ten years. In 1840 Corwin was elected governor
of Ohio, after a brilliant and successful state-wide
campaign. He was incomparable on the stump, and he
rode into the gubernatorial chair on an overwhelming
Whig tide. Two years later, however, his former opponent,
Wilson Shannon, defeated him for relection. In
1844 Corwin was sent to the United States Senate, in
which body he renewed his House reputation as an orator.
On the eve of the Mexican War, he made his memorable
anti-war speech, which practically ruined his future political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
career, as the country desired to fight the hated men
on the border. But a more bravely beautiful speech was
never made. President Fillmore chose Corwin his Secretary
of the Treasury, in 1850. At the expiration of
Fillmore's term, Corwin returned to the practice of law
at Lebanon, Ohio. In 1858 he rentered public life, serving
a term in Congress; and, in 1861, President Lincoln
appointed him minister to Mexico. Corwin remained in
Mexico until the coming of Maximilian, when he returned
to Washington to practice law. In the capital of the country
he died, December 18, 1865. "Tom" Corwin was one
of the most captivating of American orators, and most
lovable of men.</p>

<p class="center">THE MEXICAN WAR</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>Life and Speeches of Thomas Corwin</i>, by Isaac Strohn (Dayton,
Ohio, 1859)]</p>

<p>Mr. President, this uneasy desire to augment our territory
has depraved the moral sense and blunted the otherwise keen
sagacity of our people. What has been the fate of all nations
who have acted upon the idea that they must advance! Our
young orators cherish this notion with a fervid but fatally mistaken
zeal. They call it by the mysterious name of "destiny."
"Our destiny," they say, is "onward," and hence they argue,
with ready sophistry, the propriety of seizing upon any territory
and any people that may lie in the way of our "fated" advance.
Recently these progressives have grown classical; some assiduous
student of antiquities has helped them to a patron saint. They
have wandered back into the desolated Pantheon, and there,
among the polytheistic relics of that "pale mother of dead empires,"
they have found a god whom these Romans, centuries
gone by, baptized "Terminus."</p>

<p>Sir, I have heard much and read somewhat of this gentleman
Terminus. Alexander, of whom I have spoken, was a devotee of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
this divinity. We have seen the end of him and his empire. It
was said to be an attribute of this god that he must always advance
and never recede. So both republican and imperial Rome
believed. It was, as they say, their destiny. And for a while
it did seem to be even so. Roman Terminus did advance. Under
the eagles of Rome he was carried from his home on the Tiber to
the farthest East on the one hand, and to the far West, among the
then barbarous tribes of western Europe, on the other.</p>

<p>But at length the time came when retributive justice had become
"a destiny." The despised Gaul calls out the contemned
Goth, and Attila, with his Huns answers back the battle-shout to
both. The "blue-eyed nations of the North," in succession or
united, pour forth their countless hosts of warriors upon Rome
and Rome's always-advancing god Terminus. And now the
battle-axe of the barbarian strikes down the conquering eagle of
Rome. Terminus at last recedes, slowly at first, but finally he
is driven to Rome, and from Rome to Byzantium. Whoever
would know the further fate of this Roman deity, so recently
taken under the patronage of American democracy, may find
ample gratification of his curiosity in the luminous pages of Gibbon's
<i>Decline and Fall</i>.</p>

<p>Such will find that Rome thought as you now think, that it
was her destiny to conquer provinces and nations, and no doubt
she sometimes said, as you say, "I will conquer a peace," and
where now is she, the mistress of the world? The spider weaves
his web in her palaces, the owl sings his watch-song in her towers.
Teutonic power now lords it over the servile remnant, the miserable
memento of old and once omnipotent Rome. Sad, very sad,
are the lessons which time has written for us. Through and in
them all I see nothing but the inflexible execution of that old law
which ordains as eternal that cardinal rule, "Thou shalt not
covet thy neighbor's goods, nor anything which is his." Since I
have lately heard so much about the dismemberment of Mexico
I have looked back to see how, in the course of events, which some
call "Providence," it has fared with other nations who engaged
in this work of dismemberment. I see that in the latter half of
the eighteenth century three powerful nations, Russia, Austria,
and Prussia, united in the dismemberment of Poland. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
said, too, as you say, "It is our destiny." They "wanted room."
Doubtless each of these thought, with his share of Poland, his
power was too strong ever to fear invasion, or even insult. One
had his California, another his New Mexico, and the third his
Vera Cruz. Did they remain untouched and incapable of harm?
Alas! no&mdash;far, very far, from it. Retributive justice must fulfill
its destiny, too.</p>

<h2><a name="HENRY_B_BASCOM" id="HENRY_B_BASCOM">HENRY B. BASCOM</a></h2>


<p>Henry Bidleman Bascom, the distinguished Methodist
preacher and orator, was born at Hancock, New York,
May 27, 1796. He received a scanty education, and when
but eighteen years of age he was licensed to preach by the
Ohio conference of the Methodist church. He was a circuit-rider,
traveling more than four hundred miles upon
horseback his first year in the work, and receiving the
princely salary of $12.10 for his year's services. Bascom
was too florid for the Ohio brethren, and they caused him
to be transferred to Tennessee and Kentucky circuits.
In this work he won a wide reputation as a pulpit orator.
In 1823 Henry Clay had Bascom appointed chaplain of
the House of Representatives, but his long sermons did
not please the members, and he was not a great success
in Washington. Bascom was elected as the first
president of Madison College, Uniontown, Pennsylvania,
in 1827, but two years later he became an agent for the
American Colonization Society. From 1831 to 1841 he
was professor of moral science and belles-lettres in Augusta
College, Augusta, Kentucky, the first Methodist
college in the world. The Methodist church having taken
over Transylvania University, at Lexington, Dr. Bascom
was elected president of that institution in 1842. He revived
the ancient seat of learning to a wonderful degree,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
becoming another Horace Holley, but the rebirth proved
ephemeral. In 1844 President Bascom protested against
the action of the General Conference of the Methodist
church concerning slavery, and, in the Louisville conference
of 1845, he took a most prominent part, winning for
himself the title of "father of the Methodist Episcopal
Church, South." Dr. Bascom was editor of the <i>Southern
Methodist Review</i> for several years; and in 1848 he resigned
the presidency of Transylvania University, only
to be elected a bishop in the branch of the Methodist
church he had helped to establish. He was ordained as
bishop in May, 1850, and almost immediately set out for
Missouri, where he held his first and only conference. On
his return to Kentucky he was in very poor health; and he
died at Louisville, September 8, 1850. Bishop Bascom
was the greatest Methodist preacher Kentucky can claim;
and he was also an able writer. His works include <i>Sermons
from the Pulpit</i>; <i>Lectures on Infidelity</i>; <i>Lectures
and Essays on Moral and Mental Science</i>; and <i>Methodism
and Slavery</i>. In 1910 a portrait in oils of Bishop Bascom
was painted by Paul Sawyier, the Kentucky artist, for
Transylvania University.</p>

<p>I have seen, surveyed, and communed with the whole!&mdash;and
awed and bewildered, as if enchanted before the revealment of a
mystery, I attempt to write. You ask me, in your last, for some
detailed, veritable account of the Falls, and I should be glad to
gratify you; but how shall I essay to paint a scene that so utterly
baffles all conception, and renders worse than fruitless every attempt
at description? In five minutes after my arrival, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
evening of the fifth, I descended the winding-path from the
"Pavillion," on the Canadian side, and, for the first time in my
life, saw this unequaled cascade from "Table Rock;" the whole
indescribable scene, in bold outline, bursting on my view. I had
heard and read much, and imagined more of what was before me.
I was perfectly familiar with the often-told, the far-traveled story
of what I saw; but the overpowering <i>reality</i> on which I was gazing,
motionless as the rock on which I stood, deprived me of
recollection, annihilated all curiosity; and with emotions of sublimity
till now unfelt, and all unearthly, the involuntary exclamation
escaped me, "<i>God of Grandeur! what a scene!</i>"</p>

<p>But the majesty of the sight, and the interest of the moment,
how depict them? The huge amplitude of water, tumbling in
foam above, and dashing on, arched and pillared as it glides,
until it reaches the precipice of the <i>chute</i>, and then, in one vast
column, bounding with maddening roar and rush, into the depths
beneath, presents a spectacle so unutterably appalling, that language
falters; words are no longer signs, and I despair giving
you any idea of what I saw and felt. Yet this is not all. The
eye and mind necessarily take in other objects, as parts of the
grand panorama, forests, cliffs, and islands; banks, foam, and
spray; wood, rock, and precipice; dimmed with the rising fog and
mist, and obscurely gilded by the softening tints of the rainbow.
These all belong to the picture; and the effect of
the whole is immeasurably heightened by the noise of the cataract,
now reminding you of the reverberations of the heavens in
a tempest, and then of the eternal roar of ocean, when angered
by the winds!</p>

<p>The concave bed of rock, from which the water falls some two
hundred feet into the almost boundless reservoir beneath, is the
section of a circle, which, at first sight, from "Table Rock," presents
something like the geometrical curve of the rainbow; and
the wonders of the grand "crescent," thus advantageously
thrown upon the eye in combination, and the appropriate sensations
and conceptions heightened by the crash and boom of the
waters, render the sight more surpassingly sublime, than anything
I have ever looked upon, or conceived of. As it regards
my thoughts and feelings at the time, I can help you to no conception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
of their character. Overwhelming astonishment was the
only bond between thought and thought; and wild, vague, and
boundless were the associations of the hour! Before me, the
strength and fullness of the congregated "lakes of the north,"
were enthroned and concentrated within a circumference embraced
by a single glance of the eye! Here I saw, rolling and
dashing, at the rate of <i>twenty-five hundred millions of tons per
day</i>, nearly one half of all the fresh water upon the surface of the
globe! On the American side, I beheld a vast deluge, nine hundred
feet in breadth, with a fall of one hundred and eighty or
ninety, met, fifty feet above the level of the gulf, by a huge projection
of rock, which seems to break the descent and continuity
of the flood, only to increase its fierce and overwhelming bound.
And turning to the "crescent," I saw the mingled rush of foam
and tide, dashing with fearful strife and desperate emulation&mdash;four
hundred yards of the sheet rough and sparry, and the remaining
three hundred a deep sealike mass of living green&mdash;rolling
and heaving like a sheet of emerald. Even imagination
failed me, and I could think of nothing but ocean let loose from
his bed, and seeking a deeper gulf below! The fury of the water,
at the termination of its fall, combined with the columned
strength of the cataract, and the deafening thunder of the flood,
are at once inconceivable and indescribable. No imagination,
however creative, can correspond with the grandeur of the reality.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned, and it is important that you keep it
in view, the ledge of rock, the verge of the cataract, rising like a
wall of equal height, and extending in semicircular form across
the whole bed of the river, a distance of more than two thousand
feet; and the impetuous flood, conforming to this arrangement,
in making its plunge, with mountain weight, into the great horseshoe
basin beneath, exhibits a spectacle of the sublime, in geographical
scenery, without, perhaps, a parallel in nature. As I
leaned from "Table Rock," and cast my eye downward upon the
billowy turbulence of the angry depth, where the waters were
tossing and whirling, coiling and springing, with the energy of
an earthquake, and a rapidity that almost mocked my vision, I
found the scene sufficient to appal a sterner spirit than mine; and
I was glad to turn away and relieve my mind by a sight of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
surrounding scenery; bays, islands, shores, and forests, everywhere
receding in due perspective. The rainbows of the "crescent"
and American side, which are only visible from the western
bank of the Niagara, and in the afternoon, seem to diminish
somewhat from the awfulness of the scene, and to give it an
aspect of rich and mellow grandeur, not unlike the bow of promise,
throwing its assuring radiance over the retiring waters of
the deluge.</p>

<h2><a name="JAMES_T_MOREHEAD" id="JAMES_T_MOREHEAD">JAMES T. MOREHEAD</a></h2>


<p>James Turner Morehead, Kentucky's most scholarly
governor, was born near Shepherdsville, Kentucky, May
24, 1797. He was prepared for Transylvania University,
Lexington, and there he studied from 1813 to 1815. He
studied law under John J. Crittenden and, in 1818, entered
upon the practice at Bowling Green, Kentucky. Ten years
later Morehead was in the Kentucky legislature, and he
was returned for several sessions. In 1832 he was a delegate
to the Baltimore convention which nominated Henry
Clay for the presidency; and while in Baltimore he himself
was nominated for lieutenant-governor of Kentucky,
with John Breathitt for governor. They were elected in
August, 1832, but the Governor died on February 21, 1834,
and Morehead succeeded to his office on the following day.
He served until September, 1836. Upon the expiration
of his term, Governor Morehead resumed the practice of
law at Frankfort. He was elected United States Senator
from Kentucky, in 1841, and he served until 1847. Senator
Morehead was an attractive public speaker, and when
it was known in Washington that he was to make a speech
the galleries were usually well filled. After the expiration
of his term, he practiced law at Covington, Kentucky.
Senator Morehead had the most extensive collection of
books and manuscripts upon the history of Kentucky and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
the West of any man of his day and generation. After
his death, which occurred at Covington, Kentucky, December
28, 1854, his library was purchased by the Young
Men's Mercantile Library Association of Cincinnati.
Morehead's <i>Address in Commemoration of the First Settlement
of Kentucky, at Boonesborough</i> (Frankfort, 1840,
181 pp.), rescued and preserved numerous documents of
great historical importance. In the preparation of his
great <i>History of the United States</i>, George Bancroft is
said to have relied upon this famous address of Morehead
for much of his information concerning the early history
of the West. Morehead also published <i>Practice and Proceedings
at Law in Kentucky</i> (1846). The fine face of this
scholar and statesman is one of Matthew Harris Jouett's
most luminous canvasses.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The first successful attempt to explore the Kentucky country
was made by John Finley, a backwoodsman of North Carolina,
in 1767. He was attended by a few companions, as adventurous
as himself, whose names have escaped the notice of history. They
were evidently a party of hunters, and were prompted to the bold
and hazardous undertaking, for the purpose of indulging in their
favorite pursuits. Of Finley and his comrades, and of the course
and extent of their journey, little is now known. That they
were of the pure blood, and endowed with the genuine qualities,
of the pioneers, is manifestly undeniable. That they passed over
the Cumberland, and through the intermediate country to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
Kentucky river, and penetrated the beautiful valley of the Elkhorn,
there are no sufficient reasons to doubt. It is enough, however,
to embalm their memory in our hearts, and to connect their
names with the imperishable memorials of our early history, that
they were the first adventurers that plunged into the dark and
enchanted wilderness of Kentucky&mdash;that of all their contemporaries
they saw her first&mdash;and saw her in the pride of her virgin
beauty&mdash;at the dawn of summer&mdash;in the fullness of her
vegetation&mdash;her soil, instinct with fertility, covered with the
most luxuriant verdure&mdash;the air perfumed with the fragrance
of flowers, and her tall forests looming in all their primeval magnificence.</p>

<p>How long Finley lived, or where he died, the silence of history
does not enable us to know. That his remains are now mingled
with the soil that he discovered, there is some reason to hope, for
he conducted Boone to Kentucky in 1769&mdash;and there the curtain
drops upon him forever. It is fit it should be raised. It is fit
that justice, late and tardy that it be, should be done to the memory
of the first of the pioneers. And what can be more appropriate,
than that the first movement should be made for the performance
of such a duty, on the day of the commemoration of the
discovery and settlement of the Commonwealth?</p>

<p>Lewis Collins, the Kentucky historian, was born near
Lexington, Kentucky, on Christmas Day, 1797. When a
boy he entered the printing office of Joel R. Lyle, editor of
<i>The Paris Citizen</i>, where he worked for more than a year
as a printer. He removed to Mason county, Kentucky, to
become associate editor of the <i>Washington Union</i>. On November
1, 1820, Lewis Collins purchased the <i>Maysville
Eagle</i>, which had been established six years prior to his
purchase, and he made it one of the best country newspapers
ever published in Kentucky. In 1823 he was married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
to a sister of Benjamin O. Peers, afterwards president of
Transylvania University. Collins was editor of the <i>Eagle</i>
for twenty-seven years, when he retired in order to give
his entire attention to his <i>Historical Sketches of Kentucky</i>
(Maysville, 1847). This was the first illustrated history of
Kentucky, and easily the most comprehensive that had appeared.
The histories of Marshall and Butler began at
the beginning, but both concluded with the year of 1812,
while Collins brought his work down to 1844. His was a
mine of historic lore, arranged in departments, and not
altogether readable as a continuous narrative. It was
the foundation upon which his son, Richard H. Collins,
was later to build the most magnificent state history ever
published. Lewis Collins was presiding judge of the
Mason county court from 1851 to 1854. He was a just
judge, a painstaking chronicler of his people's past, and a
fine type of Christian citizen. Judge Collins died at Lexington,
Kentucky, January 29, 1870. The Kentucky legislature
passed an appropriate resolution in which his life
was commended and his death deplored.</p>

<p class="center">PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>Historical Sketches of Kentucky</i> (Maysville and Cincinnati, 1847)]</p>

<p>The late H. P. Peers, of the city of Maysville, laid the foundation
for the work which is now presented to the reading community.
Mr. Peers designed it to be simply a small <i>Gazetteer</i> of
the State; and had collected, and partially arranged for publication,
the major part of the materials, comprising a description of
the towns and counties. Upon his decease, the materials passed
into the hands of the Author, who determined to remodel them,
and make such additions as would give permanency and increased
value to the work. He has devoted much labor to this
object; but circumstances having rendered its publication necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
at an earlier day than was contemplated, some errors may
have escaped, which more time, and a fuller investigation, would
have enabled him to detect.</p>

<p>Serious obstacles have been encountered in the preparation of
the Biographical Sketches. Many of those which appear in the
work, were prepared from the personal recollections of the Author;
while others have been omitted because he did not know to
whom he could apply for them, or having applied, and in some
instances repeatedly, failed in procuring them. This is his apology
for the non-appearance of many names in that department
which are entitled to a distinguished place in the annals of Kentucky.</p>

<p>In the preparation of the work, one design of the Author has
been to preserve, in a durable form, those rich fragments of local
and personal history, many of which exist, at present, only in the
ephemeral form of oral tradition, or are treasured up among the
recollections of the aged actors in the stirring scenes, the memory
of which is thus perpetuated. These venerable witnesses from
a former age, are rapidly passing away from our midst, and with
them will be buried the knowledge of much that is most interesting
in the primitive history of the commonwealth. It is from
sources such as we have mentioned, that the materials for the future
historian are to be drawn; and, like the scattered leaves of
the Sybil, these frail mementos of the past should be gathered up
and preserved with religious veneration. If the Author shall
have succeeded, in thus redeeming from oblivion any considerable
or important portion of the early history of the State, his design
will be fully accomplished, and his labor amply rewarded.</p>

<p>Of all the members of this great republican confederacy, there
is none whose history is more rich in the variety, quality, and interest
of its materials. The poet, the warrior, and the statesman,
can each find subjects, the contemplation of which will instruct
him in his art; and to the general reader, it would, perhaps, be
impossible to present a field of more varied and attractive interest.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="JULIA_A_TEVIS" id="JULIA_A_TEVIS">JULIA A. TEVIS</a></h2>


<p>Mrs. Julia Ann (Hieronymous) Tevis, author of a delightful
autobiography, was born near Winchester, Kentucky,
December 5, 1799. When but seven years old her
parents removed to Virginia, settling at Winchester, and
at the female academy of the town her education was
begun. In 1813 Miss Hieronymous's family removed to
Georgetown, D. C., where her education was continued
under private teachers&mdash;"a considerable portion of my
time was devoted to music, drawing, and French, with
various kinds of embroidery." Two years later she was
placed in the finishing school of an English woman in
Washington where French and music continued to be her
major subjects. Miss Hieronymous completed her training
at the school of Mrs. Stone in Washington when nineteen
years of age, and returned to her home to read and
study. She spent many hours at the Capital meeting and
hearing most of the famous men of her time. At the age
of twenty years she became a school-ma'am at Wytheville,
Virginia, and the following sixty years of her life were
devoted to teaching. She later taught at Abingdon, Virginia,
where she united with the Methodist church, and
where she was married on March 9, 1824, to Rev.
John Tevis (1792-1861), a Kentucky Methodist preacher.
Mrs. Tevis desired to continue teaching, and upon her removal
to her husband's home at Shelbyville, Kentucky,
she opened Science Hill Academy. This famous old institution
for the instruction of young women&mdash;founded
March 25, 1825, and the second Protestant female academy
established in the Mississippi Valley&mdash;has continued
without interruption until the present time. The remaining
years of the founder's life were filled with the school,
her girls, her children, her cares and perplexities. In
1875 the semi-centennial of the founding of Science Hill
was celebrated in a fitting manner. Some time later Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Tevis closed the manuscripts of her autobiography, entitled
<i>Sixty Years in a School-Room</i> (Cincinnati, 1878), a
large work of nearly five hundred pages, in which the details
of her splendid service are ably set forth. Mrs.
Tevis died at Shelbyville, Kentucky, April 21, 1880. Her
pupils erected a fitting monument to her memory.</p>

<p class="center">THE MAY QUEEN</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>Sixty Years in a School-Room</i> (Cincinnati, 1878)]</p>

<p>For many years we kept up the custom of crowning a "Rose
Queen" in May, and enjoying a holiday in the woods. Happily
for the girls, I greeted the return of the festival day with a gladness
almost equal to theirs, for I retained enough of the freshness
of youth in my heart to enable me to participate with zest in the
joys of childhood.</p>

<p>"Once upon a time," after a long severe Winter, followed by
a Spring of unusual beauty, it was determined to celebrate the
day with great rejoicings. The girls were wild with delight at
the prospect of a whole day's release from slates, books, and
blackboards&mdash;a charming episode in the drudgery of their everyday
life. Ah, happy children! to whom every glimpse of nature
is beautiful, and every blade of grass a marvel! Give them ever
so small a bit of green meadow checkered with sunshine and shade
upon which to revel among buttercups and daisies, and "little
they'll reck" how the world goes on.</p>

<p>There was but little opportunity for canvassing or intrigue in
the election of Queen. Fanny Henning was chosen by acclamation
as best fitted to grace the regal authority. Fanny possessed
a mind and a character as transparent as a clear brook. Her
ingenuous face, her self-forgetting and amiable bearing towards
her companions made her the loved and cherished of them all.
She also held a distinguished place in the estimation of her teachers
for superior excellence, dutiful affection, and modest deportment.
Thus it was universally conceded that "Fair-handed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Spring" might well resign to Fanny her sovereignty for one day
over the brilliant treasures of garden, glade, and forest, awakened
into life and brightened into beauty by her magic wand.</p>

<p>The rosy hours followed each other in quick succession until
within a few days of the anticipated time, when lo! the "queen
elect" broke out with measles. The whole school was filled with
dismay, bitter tears of disappointment were shed by some; others
predicted that she would be well enough to go through the ceremony.
Fanny, uniting in their hopeful aspirations, prepared her
coronation speech and rehearsed it to perfection, for, though confined
to her room, she was not really ill. On the eve of the
appointed day, however, the doctor pronounced her too feeble to
endure the fatigue. What was to be done? The trophies of
many loyal hearts were ready to be laid at the feet of the queen.
Spirit hands seemed dispensing blessings, and guardian angels
extending their wings over these healthful, happy girls as they
diligently wrought sparkling wreaths and arranged beautiful
bouquets.</p>

<p>The banners were prepared, the white dresses were trimmed
with evergreen. The Seasons, the maids of honor, and all the
officials were in waiting, but "<i>Hamlet</i>" could not be left out of
the play. One modest little girl, after listening in silence to the
suggestions of the others, raised her eyes to my face and said hesitatingly:</p>

<p>"Can't Emma Maxwell be queen in Fanny's place?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said another; "she could not possibly learn the
speech in time."</p>

<p>"No, indeed!" exclaimed several voices at once, "that would
be impossible; but she might read it."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes! let her read it; the queen's speeches are read in
Parliament!"</p>

<p>"Will you accept the proposition?" said I, turning to Emma.</p>

<p>"I think I can learn it," she replied, "and will try if you
wish it."</p>

<p>The coronation was to take place the next morning at ten
o'clock. A previous rehearsal would be impossible; but what
Emma proudly determined to do was generously accomplished.</p>

<p>The evening star looked out bright and clear in the blue deep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
thrilling the hearts of these young girls with the prospect of a
pleasant morrow.</p>

<p>Most of them were stirring before sunrise. "Is it clear?"
"Are we going?" And from every room issued the sound of
cheerful voices; and then such shouts, such hurrying and bathing
and dressing as was seldom known before.</p>

<p>Ten o'clock came, and the yard, where the temporary throne
was erected, was soon filled with spectators and invited guests,
mingling with the children and participating in their pleasure.
The proxy queen bore her blushing honors meekly, going through
all the coronation ceremonies with a charming dignity. She stood
Calypso-like among her train of attendants in full view of the
audience who listened in breathless silence to her address. I
watched her closely; she seemed to plant her feet firmly, as if to
still the beatings of her heart; no gesture except a gentle motion
of the right arm as she swayed her scepter majestically around,
her eyes steadily fixed upon some object beyond, with which she
seemed completely absorbed. Not a word was misplaced, not a
sentence omitted, of a speech long enough for a Parliamentary
harangue. No one prompted, nor did she once turn her eyes
toward the scroll she held in her left hand. Enthusiastic and excessive
were the rejoicings of her juvenile auditors.</p>

<p>Fanny witnessed the whole ceremony through a convenient
window which framed for her a living picture of ineffable beauty,
and on this clear day, with only a few white Spring clouds floating
over the bluest of skies, it was a sight of earth that makes one
understand heaven.</p>

<p>The Seasons followed in quick succession, proffering homage to
the queen; then came the "rosy Hours" with their sweet-toned
voices, and the ceremony was completed by a few words from
"Fashion and Modesty," the latter gently pushing the former
aside, and casting a veil over the burning blushes of the queen.
The address being finished, queen and attendants walked in procession
to a grove that skirted the town, where beauty filled the
eye, and singing birds warbled sweet music. When tired of play,
a more substantial entertainment was provided. Group after
group spread the white cloth on the soft green turf, and surrounded
the plentiful repast, gratefully acknowledging the Hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
that supplies our wants from day to day. He who called our
attention to the "lilies of the field," stamps a warrant of sacredness
upon our rejoicings, in all that he has made.</p>

<p>There was something very remarkable in the quickness and
facility with which Emma Maxwell memorized the queen's speech.
She was a girl of more than ordinary vivacity, of a highly imaginative,
impressionable nature, and seemed to have the gift of bewitching
all who knew her. She occupied a commanding position
in her class as a good reciter, but I had not hitherto noticed any
great facility in memorizing. I called her the next day, and asked
her to recite the piece to me alone. She stared rather vacantly
at me, and said:</p>

<p>"I can not remember a sentence of it."</p>

<p>"What! when you repeated it with so much facility yesterday!
explain yourself."</p>

<p>"I do not know how it is," she replied, "that though I can
learn with the utmost precision, mechanically, whatever I choose,
in a short time, yet under such circumstances my memory has not
the power of retention. If my train of repetition had been interrupted
for one moment yesterday, I should have failed utterly."</p>

<p>"What were you looking at so intently the whole time?"</p>

<p>"I was looking at certain objects about the yard and house in
connection with which I had studied the speech the evening before."</p>

<p>"Yes; but you certainly can repeat some portion of it to me?"</p>

<p>"Not one sentence connectedly; it has all passed from my
mind like a shadow on the wall."</p>

<p>Yet she was a girl of good judgment, read much, talked well,
and possessed in an eminent degree the indispensable requisite
of a good memory&mdash;power of attention.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="ROBERT_J_BRECKINRIDGE" id="ROBERT_J_BRECKINRIDGE">ROBERT J. BRECKINRIDGE</a></h2>


<p>Robert Jefferson Breckinridge, LL.D., one of Kentucky's
most prolific writers for the public prints, was
born at Cabell's Dale, near Lexington, Kentucky, March
8, 1800. He was the son of John Breckinridge, President
Jefferson's Attorney-General. He studied at Princeton
and Yale, and was graduated from Union College in 1819.
Breckinridge then read law and was admitted to the Lexington,
Kentucky, bar in 1823. He practiced law for
eight years, during part of which time he was a member
of the Kentucky legislature. Realizing that Kentucky
would oppose the emancipation of the slaves, in which he
heartily believed, Breckinridge decided to quit the law
and politics for the church. He studied theology and became
pastor of the Second Presbyterian church in Baltimore,
which pastorate he held for thirteen years. In
1845 Dr. Breckinridge was elected president of Jefferson
College (now Washington and Jefferson College), at
Washington, Pennsylvania, but two years later he resigned
the presidency of the college in order to accept the
pastorate of the First Presbyterian church of Lexington,
Kentucky. In 1848 Dr. Breckinridge was elected superintendent
of public instruction of Kentucky; and in 1853
he became professor of theology in the Danville Theological
Seminary, which position he held until his death.
He was chairman of the Baltimore national convention of
1864 which nominated Abraham Lincoln for the presidency.
Dr. Breckinridge's writings include <i>Travels in
France, Germany</i>, etc. (Philadelphia, 1839); <i>Popery in
the XIX. Century in the United States</i> (1841); <i>Memoranda
of Foreign Travel</i> (Baltimore, 1845); <i>The Internal
Evidence of Christianity</i> (1852); <i>The Knowledge of God
Objectively Considered</i> (New York, 1858); and <i>The Knowledge
of God Subjectively Considered</i> (New York, 1859).
These two last named works, of enormous proportions, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
Dr. Breckinridge's greatest theological and literary productions.
He also published <i>Kentucky School Reports</i>
(1848-1853). While a resident of Baltimore he was one of
the editors of <i>The Literary and Religious Magazine</i>, and
of its successor, <i>The Spirit of the Nineteenth Century</i>, in
both of which publications he carried on many bitter and
never-ending discussions with the Roman Catholics concerning
theological and historical questions. He was also
editor of <i>The Danville Quarterly Review</i> for several
years. A complete collection of Dr. Breckinridge's
books, debates, articles, and pamphlets, upon slavery,
temperance, Popery, Universalism, Presbyterianism, education,
agriculture, and politics, would form a five-foot
shelf of books.</p>

<p class="center">SANCTIFICATION</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>The Knowledge of God Subjectively Considered</i> (New York, 1859)]</p>

<p>The completeness of the Plan of Salvation seems to be absolute.
The adaptedness of all its parts to each other, and to their own
special end&mdash;and the adaptedness of the whole and of every
part, to the great end of all, the eradication of sin and misery;
exhibits a subject, the greatest, the most intricate, and the most
remote of all in a manner so precise and clear; that the sacred
Scriptures, even if they had no grace and no mercy to offer to us
personally, might justly challenge the very highest place as the
most stupendous monument of sublime and successful thought.
What then ought we to think of them, when all this glorious intelligence
is merely tributary to our salvation? The end of this
infinite completeness, only to pour into our polluted and thoughtless
hearts, inexhaustible supplies of grace&mdash;that we may be extricated
from a condition utterly hopeless without that grace ... and
be brought to a condition unspeakably blessed to us and glorious
to God? Yet this is the overwhelming conclusion to which every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
just consideration of them forces us to come; the conclusion to
which the imperfect disclosure which has now been attempted, of
a single point in this divine system, wholly compels us. In this
deep conviction, therefore, and as the conclusion of all that has
now been advanced, I venture to define, that Sanctification is a
benefit of the Covenant of Redemption&mdash;being a work of grace,
on the part of the triune God, wherein the elect who have been
Effectually Called, Regenerated, Justified, and Adopted, are,
through the virtue of the death and resurrection of Christ, by the
indwelling of the Word and Spirit, through the use of the divine
ordinances, and by the power of God with them, enabled more
and more to die unto sin, to be renewed in the spirit of their
mind, and to live unto righteousness, in an increasing conformity
to the image of God, to his great Glory, and their growth in holiness.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caroline Lee Hentz, novelist, was born at Lancaster,

of age she was married to N. M. Hentz, a Frenchman,
then associated with George Bancroft in conducting the
Round Hill School at Northampton, Massachusetts. Two
years after her marriage her husband was elected to the

conducted a private school. Covington was the birthplace
of Mrs. Hentz's first literary work. The directors
of the Arch Street theatre, Philadelphia, had offered a
prize of five hundred dollars for the best original tragedy
founded on the conquest of the Moors in Spain, and Mrs.
Hentz submitted <i>De Lara, or, the Moorish Bride</i>, which
was awarded first place, but the prize was never paid the
author. <i>De Lara</i> was later published and successfully
produced on the stage. This encouraged Mrs. Hentz to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
write another tragedy, entitled <i>Lamorah, or, the Western
Wild</i>, a tragedy of Indian life, which was staged in Cincinnati
and published at Columbus, Georgia. Her <i>Constance
of Werdenberg</i> was written at Covington. After
two years at Covington, Mrs. Hentz crossed the Ohio
river and opened a school at Cincinnati. Her novel,
<i>Lovell's Folly</i>, was written there. In 1834 she removed
to Alabama, and this State was her home for the
subsequent fourteen years. Her first widely successful
novel, <i>Aunt Patty's Scrap-Bag</i> (Philadelphia, 1846) was
followed by her generally accepted masterpiece, <i>Linda, or,
the Young Pilot of the Belle Creole</i> (1850). Now came in
rapid succession her other works: <i>Rena, or, the Snow
Bird</i> (1851); <i>Marcus Warland</i> (1852); <i>Eoline</i>; <i>Wild Jack</i>;
<i>Helen and Arthur</i>; <i>Ugly Effie</i>; <i>The Planter's Northern
Bride</i> (1854); <i>Love after Marriage</i> (1854); <i>The Banished
Son; Robert Graham</i> (1856); and <i>Ernest Lynwood</i> (1856),
her last book and by some critics regarded as her best.
Mrs. Hentz began her literary work in Kentucky, as indicated
above, and, though the claim of Kentucky is rather
slender upon her it is, nevertheless, legitimate. She died
at Marianna, Florida, February 11, 1856.</p>

<p class="center">BESIDE THE LONG MOSS SPRING</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>Marcus Warland</i> (1852)]</p>

<p>Marcus sat beside the Long Moss Spring, the morning sun-beams
glancing through the broad leaves of the magnolia and the
brilliant foliage of the holly, and playing on his golden hair. He
held in his hand a fishing-rod, whose long line floated on the
water; and though his eye was fixed on the buoyant cork, there
was no hope or excitement in its gaze. His face was pale and
wore a severe expression, very different from the usual joyousness
and thoughtlessness of childhood. Even when the silvery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
trout and shining perch, lured by the bait, hung quivering on
the hook, and were thrown, fluttering like wounded birds through
the air, to fall panting, then pulseless, at his side, he showed no
consciousness of success, no elation at the number of his scaly
victims. Tears, even, large and slowly gathering tears, rolled
gradually and reluctantly down his fair oval cheeks; they were
not like the sudden, drenching shower, that leaves the air purer
and the sky bluer, but the drops that issue from the wounded
bark formed of the life-blood of the tree.</p>

<p>Beautiful was the spot where the boy sat, and beautiful the
vernal morning that awakened Nature to the joy and the beauty
of youth. The fountain, over whose basin he was leaning, was
one of those clear, deep, pellucid springs, that gush up in the
green wilds of southern Georgia, forming a feature of such exquisite
loveliness in the landscape, that the traveler pauses on
the margin, feeling as if he had found one of those enchanted
springs of which we read in fairy land, whose waters are too
bright, too pure, too serene for earth.</p>

<p>The stone which formed the basin of the fountain was smooth
and calcareous, hollowed out by the friction of the waters, and
gleaming white and cold through their diaphanous drapery. In
the centre of this basin, where the spring gushed in all its depth
and strength, it was so dark it looked like an opaque body, impervious
to the eye, whence it flowed over the edge of its rocky
receptacle in a full, rejoicing current, sweeping over its mossy
bed, and bearing its sounding tribute to the Chattahoochee,
"rolling rapidly." The mossy bed to which we have alluded was
not the verdant velvet that covers with a short, curling nap the
ancient rock and the gray old tree, but long, slender, emerald-green
plumes, waving under the water, and assuming through its
mirror a tinge of deep and irradiant blue. Nothing can be imagined
more rich and graceful than this carpet for the fountain's
silvery tread, and which seems to bend beneath it, as the light
spray rustling in the breeze. The golden water-lily gleamed up
through the crystal, and floated along the margin on its long and
undulating stems.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="JOHN_P_DURBIN" id="JOHN_P_DURBIN">JOHN P. DURBIN</a></h2>


<p>John Price Durbin, Seventh President of Dickinson College,
was born near Paris, Kentucky, October 10, 1800.
He was apprenticed to a cabinet-maker in Paris, and the
meager wages he received were invested in books. In
1819 Durbin became a Methodist circuit-rider. He afterwards
studied at Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, and was
graduated from Cincinnati College in 1825. In the fall
of that year he became professor of languages in Augusta
College, Augusta, Kentucky, and he occupied the chair
until 1831, when he was elected chaplain of the United
States Senate. In the next year Dr. Durbin was elected
professor of natural sciences in Wesleyan University, Middletown,
Connecticut, He remained at Wesleyan but
one year, when he was chosen editor of the New York
<i>Christian Advocate and Journal</i>. In 1834 Editor Durbin
became President Durbin of Dickinson College, Carlisle,
Pennsylvania. He is regarded as the greatest head the
college has ever known. During vacations Dr. Durbin
traveled extensively in Europe and the Orient, and these
journeys are best preserved in his books. In the 1844
General Conference of the Methodist church he was in
the thickest of the great fight over the slavery question;
and in the following year he resigned as president of
Dickinson, after more than ten years of distinguished
success in the management of the ancient college. He
now returned to the active pastorate, taking charge of the
Union Methodist church in Philadelphia. From 1850 to
1872 Dr. Durbin was secretary of the Methodist Missionary
Society, in the interest of which he visited Europe in
1867. He raised many millions of dollars for foreign
missions while he was in charge of the society. He was
the founder of foreign missions in Bulgaria. Dr. Durbin
was an eloquent and persuasive preacher, an able administrator,
and during the latter years of his life he wielded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
a wonderful influence in the Methodist church. He died
at New York City, October 17, 1876. His works include
<i>Observations in Europe</i> (New York, 1844, 2 vols.); <i>Observations
in Egypt, Palestine, Syria, and Asia Minor</i>
(New York, 1845, 2 vols.); and he edited the American
edition of Wood's <i>Mosaic History of the Creation</i> (New
York, 1831). Dr. Durbin was a rather prolific contributor
to religious and secular periodicals. His <i>Observations
in Europe</i> is the best literary work he did.</p>

<p class="center">IMPRESSIONS OF LONDON</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>Observations in Europe</i> (New York, 1844, v. ii)]</p>

<p>The first impression of London is usually wonder at its <i>immensity</i>.
I received this impression in its full force, as the reader
will have already perceived, in coming up the Thames. Nor did
it diminish in the course of my rambles through the great metropolis,
subsequently. When the stranger first leaves the river,
and plunges into the thronged streets, he absolutely becomes
dizzy in the whirl of busy life around him. Men sweep by him
in <i>masses</i>; at times the way seems wedged with them: wagons,
carts, omnibuses, hacks, and coaches block up the avenues, and
make it quite an enterprise to cross them. Every day my amazement
increased at the extent, the activity, the wealth of London.
The impression was totally different from that of Paris. The
French capital strikes you as the seat of human enjoyment. You
find the art of life, so far as mere physical good is concerned, in
perfection there. No wish need be ungratified. Your taste may
be gratified with the finest music, the most fascinating spectacles,
the most splendid works of art in the world. You may eat and
drink when and where you please; in half an hour, almost any
delicacy that earth has produced or art invented is set before you.
You may spend days and weeks in visiting her museums, her
hospitals, her gardens, her cemeteries, her libraries, her palaces,
and yet remain unsatisfied. In London everything is different.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
Men are active, but it is in pursuit of wealth. In general they
do not seem to enjoy life. The arts are cultivated to a small extent
by a small class of society; the mass seem hardly to know
that arts exist. No splendid collections are open, without fee or
reward, to the public, or to you. You can purchase gratification,
but of a lower order than in Paris, and at a higher price. Except
a few <i>lions</i>&mdash;the Docks, the Tunnel, Westminster Abbey, <i>&amp;c.</i>&mdash;nearly
everything that the city has to show to a stranger can be
seen as you ride along the streets. When you leave Paris you
have just begun to enjoy it, and desire to return again; you leave
London convinced, indeed, of its vastness and wealth, but tired of
gazing at dingy buildings and thronged streets, and are satisfied
without another visit. Such, at least, were my own impressions.
Apart from private friendships and professional interests, I have
no care to see London again.</p>

<h2><a name="FORTUNATUS_COSBY_Jr" id="FORTUNATUS_COSBY_Jr">FORTUNATUS COSBY, Jr.</a></h2>


<p>Fortunatus Cosby, Junior, poet and editor, the son of a
distinguished lawyer, was born near Louisville, Kentucky,
May 2, 1801. He was educated at Yale and Transylvania,
then studied law, but, like so many literary men have
done, never practiced. Cosby was a passionate lover of
books, and most of his life was spent among his collection.
He was wealthy and well able to indulge his taste to any
extreme. His kinsman, President Thomas Jefferson, offered
to make him secretary of the legation at London,
but he declined. Cosby was some years later superintendent
of the Philadelphia public schools, and a contributor
to <i>Graham's Magazine</i>, as well as to other high-class
periodicals. In 1846 he was editor of the Louisville <i>Examiner</i>,
the first Kentucky paper devoted to emancipation
of the slaves. In 1860 Cosby was appointed consul to
Geneva, and the next eight years of his life were devoted
to his diplomatic duties and to traveling. He returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
to the United States in 1868, and to his old home near
Louisville. There death found him in June, 1871. Several
of his friends, which included William Cullen Bryant,
Rufus W. Griswold, and George D. Prentice, often urged
Cosby to collect his verse and bring it together in a volume,
but he was "too careless of his fame to do it;" and
"many waifs he from time to time contributed to the periodicals,"
are now lost to the general public. He is, of
course, well represented in all of the anthologies of American
poetry, but a collection of his writings should be
made. Cosby's best work is to be seen in his <i>Fireside
Fancies</i>, <i>Ode to the Mocking Bird</i>, <i>The Traveler in the
Desert</i>, and <i>A Dream of Long Ago</i>. He has often been
pronounced the best song writer this country has produced;
and that he was a man of fine culture, an ardent
lover of books and Nature, and a maker of charming and
exquisite verse can be readily proved.</p>

<h2><a name="THOMAS_F_MARSHALL" id="THOMAS_F_MARSHALL">THOMAS F. MARSHALL</a></h2>


<p>Thomas Francis Marshall, the famous Kentucky orator
and advocate, was born at Frankfort, Kentucky, June 7,
1801. He was the son of Dr. Louis Marshall, a brother of
the great chief justice, and sometime president of Washington
College (Washington and Lee University). "Tom"
Marshall, to give him the name by which he was known
throughout the South and West, was educated by private
tutors, studied law under John J. Crittenden, and began
the practice at Versailles, Kentucky. From 1832 to 1836
he was a member of the Kentucky legislature, and his
speeches in that body, as well as in other places,
brought him a great reputation as a brilliant and witty
orator. The habit of drink was fastening itself upon him,
however, and this retarded his progress in the world.
Marshall was elected to Congress from the old Ashland
district in 1840, and in that body he always bitterly opposed
most measures proposed by Henry Clay, whom he
afterwards eloquently eulogized. In 1841 his distinguished
friend, Richard H. Menefee, the Kentucky orator,
died, and Marshall delivered his celebrated eulogy
upon him. This address, given before the Law Society
of Transylvania University, was the greatest effort of his
life. It has been pronounced the finest speech of its character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
yet made in America. Marshall served in the Mexican
War with no great degree of gallantry; and in 1850
he opposed the third Kentucky Constitution, then in the
making, through a paper which he edited and called the
<i>Old Guard</i>. "Tom" Marshall joined many temperance societies,
and delivered many temperance speeches, but he
always violated his pledge and returned to the old paths
of drink. He was the great wit of his day and generation
in Kentucky, if not, indeed, in the whole country. His
stories are related to-day by persons who think them of
recent origin. Marshall was counsel in many noted trials
in the South and West, and his arguments to the jury
were logical and eloquent. His speech in the famous
Matt. Ward trial is, perhaps, his master effort before a
jury. In 1856 Marshall removed to Chicago, but he
shortly afterwards returned to Kentucky. In 1858-1859
he delivered lectures upon historical subjects in various
cities of the United States. The Civil War failed to interest
him at all, but he was broken in health at the time,
and preparing himself for the long journey which was
fast pressing upon him. "Tom" Marshall died near Versailles,
Kentucky, September 22, 1864. To-day he sleeps
amid a clump of trees in a Blue Grass meadow near the
little town of his triumphs and of his failures&mdash;Versailles.</p>

<p class="center">TEMPERANCE: AN ADDRESS</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>Speeches and Writings of Hon. Thomas F. Marshall</i>, edited by W. L.
Barre (Cincinnati, 1858)]</p>

<p>Mr. President, we of the "Total Abstinence and Vigilance Society,"
in our meetings at the other end of the city [Washington]
are so much in the habit of "telling experiences," that I myself
have somewhat fallen into it, and am guilty occasionally of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
egotism of making some small confessions (as small as I can possibly
make them). Mine, then, sir, was a different case. I had
earned a most unenviable notoriety by excesses which, though
bad enough, did not half reach the reputation they won for me.
I never was an habitual drunkard. I was one of your spreeing
gentry. My sprees, however, began to crowd each other and my
best friends feared that they would soon run together. Perhaps
my long intervals of entire abstinence&mdash;perhaps something peculiar
in my form, constitution, or complexion&mdash;may have prevented
the physical indications, so usual, of that terrible disease,
which, till temperance societies arose, was deemed incurable and
resistless. Perhaps I had nourished the vanity to believe that
nature had endowed me with a versatility which enabled me to
throw down and take up at pleasure any pursuit, and I chose to
sport with the gift. If so, I was brought to the very verge of a
fearful punishment. Physicians tell us that intemperance at last
becomes, of itself, not a habit voluntarily indulged, but a disease
which its victim cannot resist. I had not become fully the subject
of that fiendish thirst, that horrible yearning after the distillation
"from the alembick of hell," which is said to scorch in
the throat, and consume the vitals of the confirmed drunkard,
with fires kindled for eternity. I did become alarmed, and for
the first time, no matter from what cause, lest the demon's fangs
were fastening upon me, and I was approaching that line which
separates the man who frolics, and can quit, from the lost inebriate,
whose appetite is disease, and whose will is dead. I joined
the society on my own account, and felt that I must encounter
the title of "reformed drunkard," annoying enough to me, I assure
you. I judged, from the cruel publicity given through the
press to my frolics, what I had to bear and brave. But I did
brave it all; and I would have dared anything to break the chain
which I at last discovered was riveting my soul, to unclasp the
folds of that serpent-habit whose full embrace is death. Letters
from people I never had heard of, newspaper paragraphs from
Boston to New Orleans were mailed, and are still mailing to me,
by which I am very distinctly, and in the most friendly and
agreeable manner, apprised that I enjoyed all over the delectable
reputation of a sot, with one foot in the grave, and understanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
almost totally overthrown. I doubt not, sir, that the societies
who have invited me to address them at different places in the
Union, will expect to find me with an unhealed carbuncle on my
nose, and my body of the graceful and manly shape and proportion
of a demijohn. I have dared all these annoyances, all this
celebrity. I have not shrunk from being a text for temperance
preachers, and a case for the outpouring of the sympathies of
people who have more philanthropy than politeness, more temperance
than taste. I signed the pledge on my own account, sir,
and my heart leaped to find that I was free. The chain has fallen
from my freeborn limbs; not a link or fragment remains to tell
I ever wore the badge of servitude.</p>

<h2><a name="JEFFERSON_J_POLK" id="JEFFERSON_J_POLK">JEFFERSON J. POLK</a></h2>


<p>Jefferson J. Polk, an eccentric clergyman, physician, and
writer, was born near Georgetown, Kentucky, March 10,
1802. He spent his young manhood as a printer on the
<i>Georgetown Patriot</i>, and the <i>Kentucky Gazette</i>. In 1822
Polk joined the Lexington Temperance Society, and he
continued steadfast in the cause until his death. He subsequently
united with the Methodist church of Lexington,
and married; but he continued to work as a journeyman-printer
until 1826, when he removed to Danville, Kentucky,
where he purchased and became editor of <i>The
Olive Branch</i>, a weekly newspaper. This he conducted
for several years, when he disposed of it in order to become
an agent for the American Colonization Society.
Polk held that emancipation with colonization in Liberia
or elsewhere was the only proper and just solution of the
slavery question. The awful Asiatic cholera reached Danville
in 1833&mdash;as it did nearly a dozen other Kentucky
towns&mdash;and Polk played his part in the battle which was
waged against it. A short time later he became a Methodist
circuit-rider, but, in 1839, he went to Lexington to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
study medicine at Transylvania Medical School. In the
following year Dr. Polk removed to Perryville, Kentucky,
some miles from Danville, and this was his future
home. Here he practiced medicine and preached the Gospel
for the next twenty years. In 1860 he supported John
Bell of Tennessee for president, but, when Lincoln was
elected, he became a strong Union man. The battle of
Perryville (October 8, 1862), the greatest battle ever
fought upon Kentucky soil, was waged before the good
doctor's very door. He converted his house into a hospital,
and himself acted as surgeon of a field hospital.
After the war he was postmaster of Perryville and claim
agent for Union soldiers. At the age of sixty-five years,
this eccentric old man published one of the literary curiosities
of Kentucky literature, yet withal a work of real
interest and much first-hand information. The little volume
was entitled <i>Autobiography of Dr. J. J. Polk, to
which is added his occasional writings and biographies of
worthy men and women of Boyle County, Kentucky</i>
(Louisville, 1867). From the frontispiece portrait the
author looks fiercely out at the reader, a real son of thunder.
Besides the autobiography of Dr. Polk the volume
contains sketches of men, women, and places, fables,
proverbs, sermons, woman's rights, a ghost story, "love
powders," reflections of an old man, biographies of a
group of the doctor's parishioners&mdash;all crowded into
the 254 pages of this book. Dr. Polk died at Perryville,
Kentucky, May 23, 1881.</p>

<p class="center">THE BATTLE OF THE BOARDS</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>Autobiography of Dr. J. J. Polk</i> (Louisville, Kentucky, 1867)]</p>

<p>In the early settlement of Kentucky, when the Indians still
roved through our dense forests, plundering and murdering the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
white inhabitants, three men left Harrod's Station to search for
their horses that had strayed off. They pursued their trail
through the rich pea-vine and cane, that everywhere abounded,
for many miles. Frequently on their route they saw signs that
a party of Indians were in their vicinity, hence they took every
step cautiously. Thus they traveled all day. Toward night
they were many miles from home, but they continued their search
until darkness and a cold rain that began to fall drove them to
take shelter in an old deserted log cabin, thickly surrounded by
cane and matted over with grape-vines. After they had gained
this pleasant retreat they held a consultation, and agreed not to
strike a fire, as the Indians, if any in the neighborhood, knew the
location of the cabin, and, like themselves, might take shelter in
it, and murder or expel the white intruders. Finally, the three
now in possession, concluded to ascend into the loft of the cabin,
the floor of which was clap-boards, resting upon round poles. In
their novel position they lay down quietly side by side, each man
holding his trusty rifle in his arms. Thus arranged, they awaited
the results of the night.</p>

<p>They had not been in their perilous position long when six
well-armed Indians entered the cabin, placed their guns and
other implements of warfare in one corner of the house, struck
a light, and began to make the usual demonstrations of joy on
such occasions. One of our heroes wished to know the number
of the Indians&mdash;he was the middle man of the three, and was
lying on his back&mdash;and, as hilarity and mirth "grew thick and
fast" among the Indians, he attempted to turn over and get a
peep at things below. His comrades caught him on each side to
keep him from turning over, and, in the struggle, one of the poles
broke, and with a tremendous crash the clap-boards and the three
men fell in the midst of the Indians, who with a loud yell of terror
fled from the house, leaving their guns, and never returned.</p>

<p>The three men who had thus made a miraculous escape from
the savage foe, remained all night in quiet possession of the cabin,
and in the morning returned to the station with their trophies.
Whenever the three heroes met in after life they laughed over
their strange deliverance, and what they called "The Battle of
the Boards."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="GEORGE_D_PRENTICE" id="GEORGE_D_PRENTICE">GEORGE D. PRENTICE</a></h2>


<p>George Dennison Prentice, poet, editor, wit, and founder
of the <i>Journal School of Female Poets</i>, was born at Preston,
Connecticut, December 18, 1802. In the fall of 1820
Prentice entered the Sophomore class of Brown University,
Providence, Rhode Island, where one of his instructors
was Horace Mann, and among his classmates was
Samuel G. Howe. At college he was famous for his prodigious
memory. Prentice was graduated from Brown
in 1823, after which he taught school for some time. He
next turned to the law, but this he also abandoned to
enter upon his life work&mdash;journalism. In 1827 he became
editor of a paper in New London, Connecticut,
but in the following year he went to Hartford to take
charge of the <i>New England Review</i>, which "was the
Louisville <i>Journal</i>, born in Connecticut." In 1830 the
Connecticut Whigs requested Prentice to journey to Kentucky
and prepare a campaign life of Henry Clay. He
finally decided to do this, naming John Greenleaf Whittier,
the good Quaker poet, as his successor in the editorial
chair of <i>The Review</i>, and setting out at once upon his
long pilgrimage to Lexington. He dashed off his biography
of the statesman in a few months, and it greatly
pleased the Whigs of his State, but Prentice had decided
to remain in Kentucky. He went to Louisville, and on
November 24, 1830, the first issue of the <i>Louisville Journal</i>
appeared, and George D. Prentice had at last come
into his very own. His pungent paragraphs made the
"Yankee schoolmaster" feared by editors in the remotest
corners of the country, but more especially by Shadrach
Penn, editor of the <i>Louisville Advertiser</i>, the Democratic
organ, as the <i>Journal</i> was the Whig organ. After a constant
warfare of more than ten years, poor Penn capitulated,
and removed to Missouri. Prentice found another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
foe worthy of his steel in John H. Harney, editor of the
Louisville <i>Daily Democrat</i>, but the battle of the wits between
them was not as keen as it was between him and
Penn. Prentice survived both editors and wrote exquisite
eulogies upon them! He also had many personal encounters,
which his biographer, Mr. John James Piatt, the
Ohio poet, declines to dignify with the term of "duel."
His pistol "brush" with Col Reuben T. Durrett, the Kentucky
historical writer and collector, was, perhaps, his
most serious affair. And the colonel lived to write a fine
tribute to him, which was turning the tables upon him just
a bit! Prentice's home in Louisville was the center of
the city's literary life for many years. His wife was a
charming and cultured woman, in every way fitted to assist
him. A volume of his witty paragraphs, called by
the publishers, <i>Prenticeana</i> (New York, 1859), attracted
attention in London and Paris, and in all parts of the
United States. Next to Whig politics, the <i>Journal</i> was
the literary newspaper of the country. All Western and
Southern poets were welcomed to its columns, particularly
were female poets "featured," and upon them all Prentice
poured out indiscriminate praise, which may or may
not have been good for them or for the public. At any
rate, he never failed to send a kindly letter to each new
"discovery," in which their work already submitted was
extravagantly valued, and in which they were urged to
flood the office with more of the same kind. His praise of
Amelia B. Welby, the sentimental singer of the long ago,
seems indefensible to-day. As a poet himself Prentice
was a master of blank verse forms. Mr. Piatt put him
next to Bryant among American poets in the handling of
this difficult measure. <i>The Closing Year</i>, written in 1835,
is undoubtedly his finest poem; and <i>At My Mother's
Grave</i> is usually set beside it. Although his sons, wife,
and most of his friends sympathized with the South in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
war of Sections, Prentice was always an ardent advocate
of the Union cause. He died near Louisville, on the banks
of the Ohio river, January 22, 1870. Henry Watterson
delivered an eulogy upon him, and snugly adjusted his
mantle about his own shoulders.</p>

<h2><a name="ROBERT_M_BIRD" id="ROBERT_M_BIRD">ROBERT M. BIRD</a></h2>


<p>Robert Montgomery Bird, creator of <i>Nick of the Woods</i>,
was born at Newcastle, Delaware, in 1803. He early
abandoned the practice of medicine in Philadelphia in
order to devote his entire attention to literature. His first
works were three tragedies, entitled <i>The Gladiator</i>, <i>Oraloosa</i>,
and <i>The Broker of Bogota</i>, the first of which was
very popular on the stage. In 1834 Dr. Bird published
his first novel, <i>Calavar</i>, a romance of Mexico that was
highly praised by William H. Prescott. In the following
year <i>The Infidel</i>, sequel to <i>Calavar</i>, appeared. <i>The Hawks</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
<i>of Hawk Hollow</i>, and <i>Sheppard Lee</i> followed fast upon
the heels of <i>The Infidel</i>. Then came <i>Nick of the Woods, or
the Jibbenainosay</i> (Philadelphia, 1837, 2 vols.), the author's
masterpiece. The background of this fine old romance
was set against the Kentucky of 1782. Dr. Bird's Kentucky
pioneers and Indians are drawn to the life, the silly sentimentalism
of Cooper and Chateaubriand concerning the
Indian character was avoided and indirectly proved untrue.
<i>Nick of the Woods</i> was dramatized and produced upon
the stage with great success. A collection of Dr. Bird's
periodical papers was made, in 1838, and published under
the title of <i>Peter Pilgrim, or a Rambler's Recollections</i>.
This work included the first adequate description of Mammoth
Cave, in Edmonson county, Kentucky. The author
was one of the cave's earliest explorers, and his account of
it heralded its wonders to the world in a manner that had
never been done before. Just how long Dr. Bird remained
in Kentucky is not known, as no comprehensive biography
of him has been issued, but he must have been in this State
for several years prior to the publication of <i>Nick of the
Woods</i>, and <i>Peter Pilgrim</i>. His last novel was <i>Robin Day</i>
(1839). After the publication of this tale, Dr. Bird became
a Delaware farmer. In 1847 he returned to Philadelphia
and became joint editor of the <i>North American Gazette</i>.
He died at Philadelphia, January 22, 1854, of brain fever.
Morton McMichael, with whom he was associated in conducting
the <i>Gazette</i>, wrote an eloquent tribute to his memory.
Dr. Bird's poem, <i>The Beech Tree</i>, is remembered
today by many readers. But it is as the creator of <i>Nick
of the Woods</i>, a new edition of which appeared in 1905,
that his fame is firmly fixed.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Tom Bruce?" said the father, eyeing him
with surprise.</p>

<p>"Matter enough," responded the young giant, with a grin of
mingled awe and delight; "the Jibbenainosay is up again!"</p>

<p>"Whar?" cried the senior, eagerly,&mdash;"not in our limits?"</p>

<p>"No, by Jehosaphat!" replied Tom; "but nigh enough to be
neighborly,&mdash;on the north bank of Kentuck, whar he has left his
mark right in the middle of the road, as fresh as though it war but
the work of the morning!"</p>

<p>"And a clear mark, Tom?&mdash;no mistake in it?"</p>

<p>"Right to an iota!" said the young man;&mdash;"a reggelar cross
on the breast, and a good tomahawk dig right through the skull;
and a long-legg'd fellow, too, that looked as though he might
have fou't old Sattan himself!"</p>

him!" cried the commander: "thar's a harricane coming!"</p>

<p>"Who is the Jibbenainosay?" demanded Forrester.</p>

<p>"Who?" cried Tom Bruce: "Why, Nick,&mdash;Nick of the
Woods."</p>

<p>"And who, if you please, is Nick of the Woods?"</p>

<p>"Thar," replied the junior, with another grin, "thar, stranger,
you're too hard for me. Some think one thing, and some another;
but thar's many reckon he's the devil."</p>

<p>"And his mark, that you were talking of in such mysterious
terms,&mdash;what is that?"</p>

<p>"Why, a dead Injun, to be sure, with Nick's mark on him,&mdash;a
knife-cut, or a brace of 'em, over the ribs in the shape of a cross.
That's the way the Jibbenainosay marks all the meat of his killing.
It has been a whole year now since we h'ard of him."</p>

<p>"Captain," said the elder Bruce, "you don't seem to understand
the affa'r altogether; but if you were to ask Tom about the
Jibbenainosay till doomsday, he could tell you no more than he
has told already. You must know, thar's a creatur' of some sort
or other that ranges the woods round about our station h'yar,
keeping a sort of guard over us like, and killing all the brute Injuns
that ar' onlucky enough to come in his way, besides scalping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
them and marking them with his mark. The Injuns call him
<i>Jibbenainosay</i>, or a word of that natur', which them that know
more about the Injun gabble that I do, say means the <i>Spirit-that-walks</i>;
and if we can believe any such lying devils as Injuns
(which I am loath to do, for the truth ar'nt in 'em), he is neither
man nor beast, but a great ghost or devil that knife cannot harm
nor bullet touch; and they have always had an idea that our fort
h'yar in partickelar, and the country round about, war under his
protection&mdash;many thanks to him, whether he be a devil or not;
for that war the reason the savages so soon left off a worrying of
us."</p>

<p>"Is it possible," said Roland, "that any one can believe such
an absurd story?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" said Bruce, stoutly. "Thar's the Injuns themselves,
Shawnees, Hurons, Delawares, and all,&mdash;but partickelarly
the Shawnees, for he beats all creation a-killing of Shawnees,&mdash;that
believe in him, and hold him in such eternal dread, that
thar's scarce a brute of 'em has come within ten miles of the station
h'yar this three y'ar: because as how, he haunts about our
woods h'yar in partickelar, and kills 'em wheresomever he catches
'em,&mdash;especially the Shawnees, as I said afore, against which the
creatur' has a most butchering spite; and there's them among
the other tribes that call him <i>Shawneewannaween</i>, or the Howl of
the Shawnees, because of his keeping them ever a howling. And
thar's his marks, captain,&mdash;what do you make of <i>that</i>? When
you find an Injun lying scalped and tomahawked, it stands to
reason thar war something to kill him."</p>

<p>"Ay, truly," said Forrester; "but I think you have human
beings enough to give the credit to, without referring it to a supernatural
one."</p>

<p>"Strannger," said Big Tom Bruce the younger, with a sagacious
nod, "when you kill an Injun yourself, I reckon,&mdash;meaning
no offense&mdash;you will be willing to take all the honor that can
come of it, without leaving it to be scrambled after by others.
Thar's no man 'arns a scalp in Kentucky, without taking great
pains to show it to his neighbors."</p>

<p>"And besides, captain," said the father, very gravely, "thar
are men among us who have seen the creatur'!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

well pleased with his incredulity, "is an argument I can resist

<h2><a name="JOHN_A_McCLUNG" id="JOHN_A_McCLUNG">JOHN A. McCLUNG</a></h2>


<p>John Alexander McClung, Kentucky's romantic historian
and novelist, was born near the ancient town of
Washington, Kentucky, September 25, 1804. He was educated
at the Buck Pond Academy of his uncle, Dr. Louis
Marshall, near Versailles, Kentucky. Having united
with the Presbyterian church when he was sixteen years
old, McClung entered Princeton Theological Seminary,
in 1822, to fit himself for the ministry. He accepted his
first pastorate in 1828, but, as his religious views were
undergoing a profound change, he withdrew from the
church and devoted himself to literature. His first work
was a novel, called <i>Camden</i> (Philadelphia, 1830). This
was a story of the South during the Revolutionary War.
His <i>Sketches of Western Adventure</i> (Maysville, Kentucky,
1832), though almost as fictitious as <i>Camden</i>, came to be
regarded as history, and it is upon this work that McClung's
reputation rests. In a general way the <i>Sketches</i>
are "of the most interesting incidents connected with the
settlement of the West from 1755 to 1794." Many of
them are most certainly figments of the author's imagination,
yet they have come to be regarded as literal truth
and history. His story of the women at Bryant's Station,
who carried water for the defense of the fort while
it was besieged by ambushed Indians under Simon Girty,
in 1782, is his <i>piece de resistance</i>. John Filson, Alexander
Fitzroy, Gilbert Imlay, Harry Toulmin, William
Littell, Rafinesque, Marshall, and Butler, the Kentucky
historians that published their works prior to McClung's,
are silent concerning the tripping of the women to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
spring for water while the Indians lay upon the banks
of Elkhorn with rifles cocked and ready. All Indians
have been scalp-hunters, regardless of whatever else
they have been, and a woman's scalp dangling from
their sticks afforded them as much pleasure as a man's.
When the Collinses, both father and son, reached this
romance they merely reproduced it "as interesting,"
allowing it to pass without further comment of any kind.
McClung blended romance and history as charmingly as
did Judge James Hall, of Cincinnati, whom Mann Butler
took to task. The climax of this tale came in the erection
of a memorial wall encircling a spring which sprang out
of the ground some years prior to the Civil War! McClung
began the practice of law in 1835, but in 1849 he returned
to the ministry. He subsequently held pastorates
at Cincinnati and Indianapolis, but finally settled at Maysville,
Kentucky. He declined the presidency of Hanover
College, Indiana, in 1856. On August 16, 1859, McClung
was drowned in the Niagara river, his body being carried
over the falls, but it was later recovered and returned to
Kentucky for interment.</p>

<p class="center">THE WOMEN OF BRYANT'S STATION</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>Sketches of Western Adventure</i> (Cincinnati, 1838)]</p>

<p>All ran hastily to the picketing, and beheld a small party of
Indians, exposed to open view, firing, yelling, and making the
most furious gestures. The appearance was so singular, and so
different from their usual manner of fighting, that some of the
more wary and experienced of the garrison instantly pronounced
it a decoy party, and restrained the young men from sallying out
and attacking them, as some of them were strongly disposed to
do. The opposite side of the fort was instantly manned, and
several breaches in the picketing rapidly repaired. Their greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
distress arose from the prospect of suffering for water. The
more experienced of the garrison felt satisfied that a powerful
party was in ambuscade near the spring, but at the same time
they supposed that the Indians would not unmask themselves,
until the firing upon the opposite side of the fort was returned
with such warmth, as to induce the belief that the feint had succeeded.</p>

<p>Acting upon this impression, and yielding to the urgent necessity
of the case, they summoned all the women, without exception,
and explaining to them the circumstances in which they were
placed, and the improbability that any injury would be offered
them, until the firing had been returned from the opposite side
of the fort, they urged them to go in a body to the spring, and
each bring up a bucket full of water. Some of the ladies, as was
natural, had no relish for the undertaking, and asked why the
men could not bring water as well as themselves, observing that
<i>they</i> were not bullet-proof, and that the Indians made no distinction
between male and female scalps!</p>

<p>To this it was answered, that women were in the habit of
bringing water every morning to the fort, and that if the Indians
saw them engaged as usual, it would induce them to believe that
their ambuscade was undiscovered, and that they would not unmask
themselves for the sake of firing at a few women, when they
hoped, by remaining concealed a few moments longer, to obtain
complete possession of the fort. That if men should go down to
the spring, the Indians would immediately suspect that something
was wrong, would despair of succeeding by ambuscade, and
would instantly rush upon them, follow them into the fort, or
shoot them down at the spring. The decision was soon over.</p>

<p>A few of the boldest declared their readiness to brave the danger,
and the younger and more timid rallying in the rear of these
veterans, they all marched down in a body to the spring, within
point blank shot of more than five hundred Indian warriors!
Some of the girls could not help betraying symptoms of terror,
but the married women, in general, moved with a steadiness and
composure, which completely deceived the Indians. Not a shot
was fired. The party were permitted to fill their buckets, one
after another, without interruption, and although their steps became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
quicker and quicker, on their return, and when near the
gate of the fort, degenerated into a rather unmilitary celerity,
attended with some little crowding in passing the gate, yet not
more than one-fifth of the water was spilled, and the eyes of the
youngest had not dilated to more than double their ordinary size.</p>

<h2><a name="JAMES_O_PATTIE" id="JAMES_O_PATTIE">JAMES O. PATTIE</a></h2>


<p>James Ohio Pattie, an early Western traveler, was born
near Brooksville, Kentucky, in 1804. His father, Sylvester
Pattie (1782-1828), emigrated to Missouri in 1812,
and settled at St. Charles. He served in the War of 1812,
at the conclusion of which he built a saw-mill on the Gasconade
river, sending down pine lumber in rafts to St.
Louis. Several years later his wife died, leaving nine
young children, of whom James O. Pattie was the eldest.
In 1824 Sylvester Pattie became dissatisfied with his lumber
business and decided to dispose of it and undertake an
expedition into New Mexico, which was one of the first
from this country into that territory. The route pursued
by his party was quite new. James O. Pattie was at
school, but he prevailed upon his father to permit him to
accompany the expedition. It remained for him to write
a most interesting account of their remarkable journey, in
which Indians who had never seen white men before were
encountered, his own capture described, together with the
sufferings and death of his father in New Mexico. On
his return to the United States Pattie passed through
Cincinnati, where he met Timothy Flint, one of the pioneers
of Western letters, who edited his journal under
the title of <i>The Personal Narrative of James O. Pattie,
of Kentucky, during an Expedition from St. Louis,
through the Vast Regions between that Place and the Pacific
Ocean, and thence Back through the City of Mexico
to Vera Cruz, during Journeyings of Six Years; in which</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>

his Father Died; together with a description of the
Country and the Various Nations through which they
Passed</i> (Cincinnati, 1831). "One sees in [Pattie's] pages
the beginnings of the drama to be fought out in the Mexican
War." The date and place of his death are unknown.</p>

<p class="center">THE SANTA FE COUNTRY</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>The Personal Narrative of James O. Pattie, of Kentucky</i> (Cincinnati,
1831)]</p>

<p>We set off for Santa Fe on the 1st of November [1824]. Our
course for the first day led us over broken ground. We passed
the night in a small town, called Callacia, built on a small stream,
that empties into the del Norte. The country around this place
presents but a small portion of level surface.</p>

<p>The next day our path lay over a point of the mountain. We
were the whole day crossing. We killed a grey bear, that was exceedingly
fat. It had fattened on a nut of the shape and size of
a bean, which grows on a tree resembling the pine, called by the
Spanish, <i>pinion</i>. We took a great part of the meat with us. We
passed the night again in a town called Albukerque.</p>

<p>The following day we passed St. Thomas, a town situated on
the bank of the del Norte, which is here a deep and muddy
stream, with bottoms from five to six miles wide on both sides.
These bottoms sustain numerous herds of cattle. The small huts
of the shepherds, who attend to them, were visible here and there.
We reached another town called Elgidonis, and stopped for the
night. We kept guard around our horses all night, but in the
morning four of our mules were gone. We hunted for them
until ten o'clock, when two Spaniards came, and asked us what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
we would give them if they would find our mules? We told
them to bring the mules, and we would pay them a dollar. They
set off, two of our men following them without their knowledge
and went into a thicket, where they had tied the mules, and returned
with them to us. As may be supposed, we gave them
both a good whipping. It seemed at first that the whole town
would rise against us in consequence. But when we related the
circumstances fairly to the people, the officer corresponding to
our justice of the peace, said, we had done perfectly right, and
had the men put in the stocks.</p>

<p>We recommenced our journey, and passed a mission of Indians
under the control of an old priest. After crossing a point of the
mountain, we reached Santa Fe, on the 5th. This town contains
between four and five thousand inhabitants. It is situated on a
large plain. A handsome stream runs through it, adding life
and beauty to a scene striking and agreeable from the union of
amenity and cultivation around, with the distant view of the
snow clad mountains. It is pleasant to walk on the flat roofs of
the houses in the evening, and look on the town and plain spread
below. The houses are low, with flat roofs as I have mentioned.
The churches are differently constructed from the other buildings
and make a beautiful show. They have a great number of large
bells, which, when disturbed, make a noise, that would almost
seem sufficient to awaken the dead.</p>

<p>We asked the governor for permission to trap beaver in the
river Helay. His reply was that, he did not know if he was allowed
by the law to do so; but if upon examination it lay in his
power, he would inform us on the morrow, if we would come to
his office at 9 o'clock in the morning. According to this request,
we went to the place appointed, the succeeding day, which was
the 9th of November. We were told by the governor, that he had
found nothing that would justify him in giving us the legal permission
we desired. We then proposed to him to give us liberty
to trap upon the conditions that we paid him five per cent on the
beaver we might catch. He said he would consider this proposition,
and give us an answer the next day at the same hour. The
thoughts of our hearts were not at all favorable to this person,
as we left him.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="WILLIAM_F_MARVIN" id="WILLIAM_F_MARVIN">WILLIAM F. MARVIN</a></h2>


<p>William F. Marvin, "the latter-day drunken poet of Danville,"
was born at Leicestershire, England, in 1804. He
emigrated to America when a young man, and made his
home in the little town of Danville, Kentucky. Marvin
was a shoemaker by trade, but verse-making and bacchanalian
nights were his heart's delight and perfect
pleasures. He was a well-known character in Danville
and the surrounding country, and many are the old wives'
tales they tell on the old poet to this day. On one occasion,
while in his cups, of course, he attempted suicide,
using his shoe knife on his throat, but he was finally persuaded
that a shoe knife could be put to far better purposes.
Marvin served in the Mexican War, and on his
return home, he published his first and only book of verse,
<i>The Battle of Monterey and Other Poems</i> (Danville, Kentucky,
1851). The title-poem, <i>The Battle of Monterey</i>, is a
rather lengthy metrical romance of some forty or more
pages; but the "other poems," called also "miscellaneous
poems," extend the book to its 219 pages. A few of these
are worthy of preservation, especially the shorter lyrics.
Marvin's book is now extremely rare. The writer has
located not more than six copies, though a large edition
was printed by the poet's publisher, Captain A. S. McGrorty,
who is still in the land of the living. During the
closing years of his life Marvin contributed occasional
poems to the old <i>Kentucky Advocate</i>, the Danville newspaper,
his last poem having appeared in that paper, called
<i>The Beauty, Breadth, and Depth of Love</i>. William F.
Marvin died at Danville, Kentucky, July 12, 1879, and was
buried in the cemetery of the town. To-day his grave
may be identified, but it is unmarked by a monument.
His verse certainly shows decided improvement over the
rhymes of Thomas Johnson, but both of them were imperfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
forerunners of that celebrated poet and distinguished

street&mdash;Theodore O'Hara, the highest poetic note in

<h2><a name="ELISHA_BARTLETT" id="ELISHA_BARTLETT">ELISHA BARTLETT</a></h2>


<p>Dr. Elisha Bartlett, physician, poet, and politician, was
born at Smithfield, Rhode Island, in 1805. He was graduated
in medicine from Brown University in 1826, and later
practiced at Lowell, Massachusetts, of which city he was
the first mayor. Dr. Bartlett lectured at Dartmouth College
in 1839; and two years later he became professor of
the Theory and Practice of Medicine in the medical school
of Transylvania University, Lexington, Kentucky. He
left Transylvania in 1844, for the University of Maryland,
but he returned to Lexington two years later, occupying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
his former chair in the medical school. In 1849 Dr. Bartlett
left Transylvania and went to Louisville, where he
delivered medical lectures for a year. From 1851 until
his death he was professor of materia medica and medical
jurisprudence in the College of Physicians and Surgeons
of New York City. Dr. Bartlett died at his birthplace,
Smithfield, Rhode Island, July 18, 1855, one of the most
widely known of American physicians, and also well
known and highly regarded by medical men in Europe.
His medical works are: <i>Essay on the Philosophy of Medical
Science</i> (Philadelphia, 1844); <i>Inquiry into the Degree
of Certainty in Medicine</i> (1848); <i>A Discourse on the
Life and Labours of Dr. Wells, the Discoverer of the Philosophy
of Dew</i> (1849); <i>The Fevers of the United States</i>
(1850); <i>Discourse on the Times, Character, and Works of
Hippocrates</i> (1852). These are his medical works, but it
is upon his small volume of poems, <i>Simple Settings, in
Verse, for Six Portraits and Pictures, from Mr. Dickens's
Gallery</i> (Boston, 1855), that he is entitled to his place in
this work. Of this little book of but eighty pages, his
friend, Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, wrote: "Yet few
suspected him of giving utterance in rhythmical shape to
his thoughts or feelings. It was only when his failing
limbs could bear him no longer, as conscious existence
slowly retreated from his palsied nerves, that he revealed
himself freely in truest and tenderest form of expression.
We knew he was dying by slow degrees, and we heard
from him from time to time, or saw him always serene and
always hopeful while hope could have a place in his
earthly future.... When to the friends he loved there
came, as a farewell gift, ... a little book with a few songs
in it&mdash;songs with his whole warm heart in them&mdash;they
knew that his hour was come, and their tears fell fast
as they read the loving thoughts that he had clothed in
words of beauty and melody. Among the memorials of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>

<h2><a name="SAMUEL_D_GROSS" id="SAMUEL_D_GROSS">SAMUEL D. GROSS</a></h2>

<p>Dr. Samuel David Gross, the distinguished American surgeon
and author, was born near Easton, Pennsylvania,
July 8, 1805. He was graduated from the Jefferson Medical
College, Philadelphia, in the class of 1828, and he at once
entered upon the active practice of his profession in Philadelphia.
In 1833 Dr. Gross accepted a professorship in
the Ohio Medical College of Cincinnati, which position he
held until 1840, when he became professor of surgery in
the University of Louisville. The subsequent sixteen
years of Dr. Gross's life were spent upon Kentucky soil.
His <i>Report on Kentucky Surgery</i> (Louisville, 1851) contained
the first biography of Dr. Ephraim McDowell, the
Kentucky surgeon, who performed the first operation for
the removal of the ovaries done in the world. That Dr.
McDowell had actually accomplished this wonderful feat
at Danville, in 1809, was Dr. Gross's contention, and that
he was able to prove it beyond all doubt, and place the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
Danville doctor before the world as the father of ovariotomy,
proves the power of his paper. Dr. Gross was the
founder of the Louisville <i>Medical Review</i>, but he had conducted
it but a short time when he accepted the chair of
surgery in the Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia.
This position he occupied until about two years prior to
his death. Dr. Gross enjoyed an international reputation
as a surgeon. Oxford and Cambridge conferred degrees
upon him in recognition of his distinguished contributions
to medical science. As an original demonstrator
he was well known. He was among the first to urge
the claims of preventive medicine; and his demonstrations
upon rabbits, with a view to throwing additional light on
manual strangulation, are familiar to students of medicine
and medical history. His works include: <i>Elements
of Pathological Anatomy</i> (1839); <i>Foreign Bodies in the
Air-Passages</i> (1854); <i>Report on the Causes which Retard
the Progress of American Medical Literature</i>
(1856); <i>System of Surgery</i> (1859); <i>Manual of Military
Surgery</i> (1861), Japanese translation (Tokio, 1874); and
his best known work of a literary value, <i>John Hunter and
His Pupils</i> (1881). In 1875 he published two lectures,
entitled <i>The History of American Medical Literature</i>;
and, in the following year, with several other writers, he
issued <i>A Century of American Medicine</i>. Dr. Gross was
always greatly interested in the history of medicine and
surgery. He died at Philadelphia, May 6, 1884.</p>

<p class="center">THE DEATH OF HENRY CLAY</p>

<p class="center">[From the same]</p>

<p>The admirers of Mr. Clay cannot but regret the motives which
induced him to spend his last days at Washington. It was a pitiful
ambition which prompted him to forsake his family and his
old friends to die at the capital of the country in order that he
might have the <i>clat</i> of a public funeral. Broken down in health
and spirits when he left his old home, unable to travel except by
slow stages, he knew perfectly well that his days were numbered,
and that he could never again see Kentucky. How much more
dignified would it have been if he had breathed out his once
precious life in the bosom of his family and in the arms of the
woman who for upwards of half a century had watched over his
interests, reared his children with a fond mother's care, loved
him with a true woman's love, and followed him, wherever he
was, with her prayers and her blessings!</p>

<h2><a name="THOMAS_H_CHIVERS" id="THOMAS_H_CHIVERS">THOMAS H. CHIVERS</a></h2>


<p>Dr. Thomas Holley Chivers, the eccentric Southern poet,
and maker of most unusual verse forms, was born near
Washington, Georgia, December 12, 1807. He was instructed
in the classics by his mother, and, choosing medicine as
his vocation, he went to Lexington, Kentucky&mdash;most
probably making the long journey on horse-back&mdash;and
entered the medical school of Transylvania University.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
Chivers matriculated in November, 1828, and took up his
abode at the old Ph&#339;nix Hotel, as his father was wealthy
and liberal with him. He took one ticket and made it
during his first year. The college records show that he
returned for the fall session of 1829, and that, during his
second year, he took two tickets, graduating on March 17,
1830. The thesis he submitted for his degree of Doctor
of Medicine was <i>Remittent and Intermittent Bilious Fever</i>.
Kentucky was the birthplace of the first poems
Chivers wrote, and, very probably, the birthplace of his
first book, <i>Conrad and Eudora, or The Death of Alonzo</i>
(Philadelphia, 1834). This little drama, intended for the
study, was set in Kentucky, and founded upon the Beauchamp-Sharp
murder of 1825, which was still the chief
topic of conversation in the State when the poet reached
Lexington in 1828. Chivers's second book of poems,
called <i>Nacoochee</i> (New York, 1837), contained two poems
written while a student of Transylvania, entitled <i>To a
China Tree</i>, and <i>Georgia Waters</i>. A short time after the
publication of this book Chivers and Edgar Allan Poe became
acquainted; and the remainder of their lives they
were denouncing and fighting each other. It all came
about by Chivers claiming his <i>Allegra Florence in
Heaven</i>, published in <i>The Lost Pleiad</i> (New York, 1845),
as the original of <i>The Raven</i>. Of course, the world and
the critics have smiled at this claim and let it pass. After
Poe's death Chivers claimed practically everything the
Virginian did to be a plagiarism of some of his own
poems. His most famous work was <i>Eonchs of Ruby</i>
(New York, 1851). This was followed by <i>Virginalia</i>
(Philadelphia, 1853); <i>Memoralia</i> (Philadelphia, 1853);
<i>Atlanta</i> (Macon, Ga., 1853); <i>Birth-Day Song of Liberty</i>
(Atlanta, Ga., 1856); and <i>The Sons of Usna</i> (Philadelphia,
1858). Bayard Taylor, in his famous <i>Echo Club</i>,
mentioned <i>Facets of Diamond</i> as one of the poet's publications,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
but a copy of it has not yet been unearthed.
Dr. Chivers died at Decatur, Georgia, December 19, 1858.
No more pathetic figure has appeared in American letters
than Chivers. Had he been content to write his poetry
independently of Poe or any one else, he would have left
his name clearer. He was a wonderful manipulator of
verse-forms, but he was not what Poe was&mdash;a world-genius.</p>

<h2><a name="JEFFERSON_DAVIS" id="JEFFERSON_DAVIS">JEFFERSON DAVIS</a></h2>


<p>Jefferson Davis, the first and only president of the Confederacy,
was born in Christian, now Todd, county, Kentucky,
June 3, 1808. During his infancy his family removed
first to Louisiana and afterwards to Mississippi,
locating near the village of Woodville. When but seven
years old he was mounted on a pony and, with a
company of travelers, rode back to Kentucky. He entered
St. Thomas College, a Roman Catholic institution,
near Springfield, Kentucky. This tiny, obscure "college"
was presided over by Dominicans, and Davis was
the only Protestant boy in it. He spent two years at St.
Thomas, when he returned home to be fitted for college.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
In October, 1821, when in his fourteenth year, Jefferson
Davis arrived in Lexington, Kentucky, and matriculated
in the academic department of Transylvania University.
Horace Holley, surrounded with his famous faculty, was
in charge of the University during Davis's student days.
His favorite professor was Robert H. Bishop, afterwards
president of Miami University, Oxford, Ohio; and his
fellow students included David Rice Atchison, George
Wallace Jones, Gustavus A. Henry, and Belvard J. Peters,
all subsequently in Congress or on the bench. When
Davis was in the United States Senate he found five other
Transylvania men in the same body. He made his home
with old Joseph Ficklin, the Lexington postmaster, and
three of the happiest years of his life were spent in the
"Athens of the West." He left Transylvania at the end
of his junior year in order to enter West Point, from
which he was graduated in 1828. As Lieutenant Davis
he was in Kentucky during the cholera-year of 1833, and
he did all in his power to bury the dead and watch the
dying. Near Louisville, on June 17, 1835, Davis was married
to Miss Sarah Knox Taylor, second daughter of President
Taylor, but within the year the fair young girl died.
Davis was in the lower House of Congress, in 1845, as a
Democrat; but in the following year he enlisted for service
in the Mexican War, through which he served with
great credit to himself and to his country. From 1847 to
1851 he was United States Senator from Mississippi; and
from 1853 to 1857 he was Secretary of War in President
Pierce's cabinet. Davis was immediately returned to the
Senate, where he continued until January 21, 1861, when
he bade the Senators farewell in a speech that has made
him famous as an orator. Four weeks later he was inaugurated
as provisional president of the Confederate
States. On February 22, 1862, he was elected permanent
president, and settled himself in the capitol at Richmond,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
Virginia. President Davis was arrested near Irwinville,
Georgia, May 10, 1865, and for the next two years he was a
prisoner in Fortress Monroe. He died at New Orleans,
December 6, 1889, but in 1893 his body was removed to
Richmond. As an author Davis's fame must rest on his

York, 1881, two vols.).</p>

<p class="center">FROM FAREWELL SPEECH IN UNITED STATES SENATE
ON JANUARY 21, 1861</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government</i> (New York, 1881,
v. i.)]</p>

<p>It has been a conviction of pressing necessity, it has been a belief
that we are to be deprived in the Union of the rights which
our fathers bequeathed to us, which has brought Mississippi to
her present decision. She has heard proclaimed the theory that
all men are created free and equal, and this made the basis of an
attack upon her social institutions; and the sacred Declaration of
Independence has been invoked to maintain the position of the
equality of the races. That Declaration of Independence is to be
construed by the circumstances and purposes for which it was
made. The communities were declaring their independence; the
people of those communities were asserting that no man was
born&mdash;to use the language of Mr. Jefferson&mdash;booted and
spurred, to ride over the rest of mankind; that men were created
equal&mdash;meaning the men of the political community; that there
was no divine right to rule; that no man inherited the right to
govern; that there were no classes by which power and place descended
to families; but that all stations were equally within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
grasp of each member of the body politic. These were the great
principles they announced; these were the purposes for which
they made their declaration; these were the ends to which their
enunciation was directed. They have no reference to the slave;
else, how happened it that among the items of arraignment against
George III was that he endeavored to do just what the North has
been endeavoring of late to do&mdash;to stir up insurrection among
our slaves? Had the Declaration announced that the negroes
were free and equal, how was the Prince to be arraigned for raising
up insurrection among them? And how was this to be enumerated
among the high crimes which caused the colonies to
sever their connection with the mother country? When our
Constitution was formed, the same idea was rendered more palpable;
for there we find provision made for that very class of persons
as property; they were not put upon the footing of equality
with white men&mdash;not even upon that of paupers and convicts;
but, so far as representation was concerned, were discriminated
against as a lower caste, only to be represented in the numerical
proportion of three fifths.</p>

<p>Then, Senators, we recur to the compact which binds us together;
we recur to the principles upon which our Government
was founded; and when you deny them, and when you deny to us
the right to withdraw from a Government which, thus perverted,
threatens to be destructive of our rights, we but tread in the path
of our fathers when we proclaim our independence and take the
hazard. This is done, not in hostility to others, not to injure any
section of the country, not even for our own pecuniary benefit;
but from the high and solemn motive of defending and protecting
the rights we inherited, and which it is our sacred duty to transmit
unshorn to our children.</p>

<p>I find in myself, perhaps, a type of the general feeling of my
constituents towards yours. I am sure I feel no hostility towards
you, Senators from the North. I am sure there is not one of you,
whatever sharp discussion there may have been between us, to
whom I cannot now say, in the presence of my God, I wish you
well; and such, I am sure, is the feeling of the people whom I
represent towards those whom you represent. I, therefore, feel
that I but express their desire when I say I hope, and they hope,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
for peaceable relations with you, though we must part. They
may be mutually beneficial to us in the future, as they have been
in the past, if you so will it. The reverse may bring disaster on
every portion of the country; and, if you will have it thus, we
will invoke the God of our fathers, who delivered them from the
power of the lion, to protect us from the ravages of the bear; and
thus, putting our trust in God and in our own firm hearts and
strong arms, we will vindicate the right as best we may.</p>

<p>In the course of my service here, associated at different times
with a great variety of Senators, I see now around me some with
whom I have served long; there have been points of collision;
but, whatever of offense there has been to me, I leave here. I
carry with me no hostile remembrance. Whatever offense I have
given which has not been redressed, or for which satisfaction has
not been demanded, I have, Senators, in this hour of our parting,
to offer you my apology for any pain which, in heat of discussion,
I have inflicted. I go hence unencumbered of the remembrance
of any injury received, and having discharged the duty of making
the only reparation in my power for any injury offered.</p>

<p>Mr. President and Senators, having made the announcement
which the occasion seemed to me to require, it only remains for
me to bid you a final adieu.</p>

<h2><a name="WILLIAM_D_GALLAGHER" id="WILLIAM_D_GALLAGHER">WILLIAM D. GALLAGHER</a></h2>


<p>William Davis Gallagher, poet and critic, was born at
Philadelphia, August 21, 1808. When he was but eight
years old he removed to Cincinnati with his mother, a
widow. In 1821 he was apprenticed to a Cincinnati
printer. At the age of twenty years Gallagher journeyed
through Kentucky and Mississippi, and his letters concerning
the country and the people won him his first fame
as a writer. In 1831 he became editor of the Cincinnati
<i>Mirrow</i>, the fifth or sixth literary journal published in the
West. Three years later Thomas H. Shreve joined Gallagher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
in editing the paper. Like all Western magazines,
the <i>Mirrow's</i> high hopes were utterly dashed upon the old
rocks of failure from one cause or another. In 1835 Gallagher
published <i>Erato No. I.</i>, and <i>Erato No. II.</i>, which
were two small pamphlets of poems. <i>Erato No. III.</i> was
published at Louisville, two years later. The chief poem
in this was upon a Kentucky subject. Gallagher's anthology
of Western verse, without biographical or critical
notes, entitled <i>The Poetical Literature of the West</i> (Cincinnati,
1841), the first work in that field, was well
done, and it strengthened his claim as a critic. In
1854 he became one of the editors of the <i>Louisville Courier</i>;
but he shortly afterwards purchased a farm near
Pewee Valley, Kentucky, some twelve miles from Louisville,
and as a Kentucky farmer he spent the final forty
years of his life. He took keen interest in agricultural
pursuits, but he made nothing more than a meager living
out of his farm. His essay on <i>Fruit Culture in the Ohio
Valley</i> attracted the attention of persons interested in that
subject. As a poet Gallagher submits his claim upon a
rather long pastoral poem, entitled <i>Miami Woods</i>. This
work was begun in 1839, and finished seventeen years
later. This gives the title of his book of poems, <i>Miami
Woods, A Golden Wedding, and Other Poems</i> (Cincinnati,

production, and the poet is best seen in his shorter lyrics.

career with great promise, and he pursued it diligently

<h2><a name="THOMAS_H_SHREVE" id="THOMAS_H_SHREVE">THOMAS H. SHREVE</a></h2>


<p>Thomas H. Shreve, poet and journalist, was born at Alexandria,
Virginia, in 1808. In early life he removed to
Louisville, Kentucky, and entered mercantile pursuits.
In 1834 Shreve became a Cincinnati editor; but four
years later he returned to Louisville to again engage
in business. Throughout his business career, Shreve
was a constant contributor of poems and prose sketches
to the best magazines. He finally abandoned business for
literature, and he at once became associate editor of the
<i>Louisville Journal</i>. He was not a rugged journalist of
the Prentice type, but a cultured and chaste essayist who
should have written from his study window, rather than
from such a seething hothouse of sarcasm and invective
as Prentice maintained. He was a mild-mannered man,
a Quaker, who spent his last months on earth in crossing
swords with Thomas Babington Macaulay concerning the
character of William Penn. In 1851 Shreve's <i>Drayton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
an American Tale</i>, was issued by the Harpers at New
York. This work won the author much praise in the East
as well as in the West, and it started him upon an honorable
career, which was soon cut short by disease. Thomas
H. Shreve died at Louisville, December 23, 1853. Prentice
penned a splendid tribute to the memory of his dead
friend and associate; and some years later a collection of
his verse was made as a fitting memorial of his blameless
life and literary labors.</p>

<p>Ormsby MacKnight Mitchel, the celebrated American
astronomer and author, was born near Morganfield,
Kentucky, August 28, 1809. He graduated from West
Point in the famous class of 1829 which included
Robert E. Lee and Joseph E. Johnston, Mitchel was professor
of mathematics at West Point for two years; but
he later studied law and practiced at Cincinnati for a
year. In 1834 he was elected professor of mathematics
and astronomy in Cincinnati College. By his own efforts
he raised sufficient funds with which to establish an astronomical
observatory in Cincinnati, in 1845&mdash;now the
Mitchel Observatory&mdash;the first of the larger observatories
in this country. In 1860 Professor Mitchel was
chosen as director of the Dudley observatory at Albany,
New York, and there he remained for two years. The
Civil War coming on, he entered the Union army, and rose
to the rank of general. General Mitchel was placed in
command of the "Department of the South," but before
the war was well under way, almost, he contracted yellow
fever and died at Beaufort, South Carolina, October 30,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
1862. General Mitchel was the most distinguished astronomer
ever born on Kentucky soil; and in the army the
men knew him as "Old Stars." He was a popular lecturer,
but it is as an author that his great reputation
rests. His books are: <i>The Planetary and Stellar
Worlds</i> (New York, 1848); <i>The Orbs of Heaven</i> (1851);
<i>A Concise Elementary Treatise of the Sun, Planets, Satellites,
and Comets</i> (1860); and <i>The Astronomy of the
Bible</i> (New York, 1863). From 1846 to 1848 General
Mitchel published an astronomical journal, called <i>The
Sidereal Messenger</i>. Harvard and Hamilton Colleges
conferred honorary degrees upon him; and he was a member
of many scientific societies in the United States and
Europe.</p>

<p class="center">ASTRONOMICAL EVIDENCES OF GOD</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>The Astronomy of the Bible</i> (New York, 1863)]</p>

<p>If we extend our researches beyond the limits of the solar system,
and, passing across the mighty gulf which separates us from
the starry heavens, inspect minutely the organizations which are
there displayed, we find the dominion of these same laws extending
to these remote regions, and holding an imperious sway over
revolving suns. Thus we perceive, that in one most important
particular, the objects which compose the mighty universe are
obviously alike, and seem to have sprung from a common origin.
We are, moreover, compelled to admit a sun in every visible star;
and if a sun, then attendant planets; and if revolving planets,
then, likewise, some scheme of sentient existence, possibly remotely
analogous to that which is displayed with such wonderful
minuteness in our globe. Thus if the being of a God can be
argued from the admirable adaptations which surround man in
this nether world, every star that glitters in the vast concave of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
heaven proclaims, with equal power, this mighty truth. If we
rise still higher, and from the contemplation of individual stars,
examine their distribution, their clusterings, their aggregations
into immense systems, the fact of their mutual influences, their
restless and eternal activity, their amazing periods of revolution,
their countless millions, and their ever-during organizations, the
mind, whelmed with the display of grandeur, exclaims involuntarily,
"This is the empire of a God!"</p>

<p>And now, how is the knowledge of this vast surrounding universe
revealed to the mind of man? Here is, perhaps, the crowning
wonder. Through the agency of light, a subtle, intangible,
imponderable something, originating, apparently, in the stars and
suns, darting with incredible velocity from one quarter of the
universe to the other, whether in absolute particles of matter shot
off from luminous bodies, or by traces of an ethereal fluid, who
shall tell? This incomprehensible fluid falls upon an instrument
of most insignificant dimensions, yet of most wonderful construction,
the human eye, and, lo! to the mind what wonders start into
being. Pictures of the most extravagant beauty cover the earth;
clouds dipped in the hues of heaven fill the atmosphere; the sun,
the moon, the planets, come up from out of the depths of space,
and far more amazing still, the distant orbs of heaven, in their
relative magnitudes, distances and motions, are revealed to the
bewildered mind. We have only to proceed one step further, and
bringing to the aid of the human eye, the auxiliary power of the
optic glass, the mind is brought into physical association with objects
which inhabit the confines of penetrable space. We take
cognizance of objects so remote, that even the flashing element of
light itself, by which they are revealed, flies on its errand ten
times ten thousand years to accomplish its stupendous journey.</p>

<p>Strike the human eye from existence, and at a single blow, the
sun is blotted out, the planets fade, the heavens are covered with
the blackness of darkness, the vast universe shrinks to a narrow
compass bounded by the sense of touch alone.</p>

<p>Such, then, is the organization of the universe, and such the
means by which we are permitted to take cognizance of its existence
and phenomena. If the feeble mind of man has achieved
victories in the natural world&mdash;if his puny structures, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
have survived the attacks of a few thousand years, proclaim the
superiority of the intelligence of his mind to insensate matter&mdash;if
the contemplation of the works of art and the triumphs of human
genius, swells us into admiration at the power of this invisible
spirit that dwells in mortal form,&mdash;what shall be the
emotions excited, the ideas inspired, by the contemplation of the
boundless universe of God?</p>

<h2><a name="ALBERT_T_BLEDSOE" id="ALBERT_T_BLEDSOE">ALBERT T. BLEDSOE</a></h2>


<p>Albert Taylor Bledsoe, controversialist, was born at
Frankfort, Kentucky, November 9, 1809, the son of a journalist.
He was appointed from Kentucky to West Point
and was graduated in 1830, after which he served in the
army in Indian territory until the last day of August,
1832, when he resigned to enter upon the study of law.
A year later Bledsoe abandoned law to become a tutor in
Kenyon College, Ohio, where he later studied theology
and was ordained a clergyman in the Protestant Episcopal
church. He was connected with various Ohio churches
from 1835 to 1838, but in the latter year he quit the ministry
to resume his legal studies and he removed to
Springfield, Illinois, where he formed a partnership with
the afterwards celebrated statesman and soldier, Colonel
Edward D. Baker. Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A.
Douglas were practicing law in Springfield at this time,
and Bledsoe knew both of them intimately; but because
of his subsequent connection with the Southern Confederacy
none of the biographies of these men mention him.
For the following ten years Bledsoe practiced his profession
at Springfield and Washington, D. C. His first book,
<i>An Examination of Edwards's Inquiry into the Freedom
of the Will</i> (Philadelphia, 1845), showed that his interest
in theological subjects had not waned. In 1848 Bledsoe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
was elected professor of mathematics in the University of
Mississippi, which position he held for the ensuing six
years. His next volume, <i>A Theodicy, or Vindication of
the Divine Glory</i> (New York, 1853), gave him a place
among theologians. In 1854 Dr. Bledsoe was elected to
the chair of mathematics in the University of Virginia,
and this he occupied until 1861. While at the University
he published <i>An Essay on Liberty and Slavery</i> (Philadelphia,
1856), which anticipated his subsequent action of
entering the Confederate army, which he did in 1861, and
he was commissioned as a colonel. Dr. Bledsoe was
speedily made assistant secretary of war, but this work
proved most uncongenial, and he gladly accepted the joint
invitation of Davis and Lee to run the blockade, in 1863,
and go to England to gather materials for a constitutional
argument on the right of secession. He spent three
years in London and upon his return to the United States,
in February, 1866, he brought his vast researches together
in his best known work, <i>Is Davis a Traitor? or was Secession
a Constitutional Right Previous to the War of 1861?</i>
(Baltimore, 1866). Dr. Bledsoe now took up his residence
at Baltimore, and some months later he became editor
of a quarterly periodical, <i>The Southern Review</i>,
which he conducted for the final years of his life. In
1868 he added the principalship of a Baltimore school to
his burdens; and in the same year his last volume appeared,
<i>The Philosophy of Mathematics</i> (Philadelphia,
1868). In 1871 Dr. Bledsoe was ordained a minister in
the Methodist church, and his <i>Review</i> became the recognized
organ of his church. He died at Alexandria, Virginia,
December 8, 1877. Dr. Bledsoe was always a student
and scholar, but he was essentially a controversialist,
often bitter in his statements, but time has mellowed much
of this, and he now stands forth as a very remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
man. Consider him from a dozen angles, and one will not
find his like in the whole range of American history.</p>

<p class="center">SEVEN CRISES CAUSED THE CIVIL WAR</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>The Southern Review</i> (Baltimore, April, 1867)]</p>

<p>This history consists of seven great crises. The first of these
convulsed the Union, and threatened its dissolution before the
new Constitution was formed, or conceived. For how little soever
its history may be known, the North and the South, like
Jacob and Esau, struggled together, and that, too, with almost
fatal desperation, in the womb of the old Union. Slavery had
nothing at all to do with that struggle between the North and the
South, the <i>dramatis person</i> in the tragedy of 1861. It was
solely and simply a contest for power.</p>

<p>The second crisis was the formation and adoption of the new
Constitution. Much has been said about that event, as the most
wonderful revolution in the history of the world; because the
government of a great people was then radically changed by
purely peaceable means, and without shedding a drop of blood.
But if that was a bloodless revolution in itself, no one, who has
maturely considered it in all its bearings, can deny that it was,
in the end, the occasion of the most sanguinary strife in the annals
of a fallen world.</p>

<p>The revolution of 1801, by which the radical notions and doctrines
of the infidel philosophers of the eighteenth century gained
the ascendency in this country, never more to abate in their onward
march, constituted the third great crisis in the political history
of the United States. In passing through this crisis, the
Republic of 1787 became in practice the Democracy of the following
generation; and, finally, the rabid radicalism of 1861. It
was then that the democratic, or predominant, element in the Republic,
began to swallow up the others, and so became the most
odious of all the forms of absolute power or despotism. It was
then that the reign of "King Demos," the unchecked and the unlimited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
power of mere numbers, was inaugurated, and his throne
established on the ruins of American freedom. But, while history
will show this, it will also administer the consoling reflection,
that American freedom was doomed, from the first, by the operation
of other causes, and that the revolution of 1801 only precipitated
its fall. If so, then the sooner its fall the better for the
world; as in that case its destruction would involve a smaller portion
of the human family in its ruins.</p>

<p>The desperate struggle of 1820-21, between the North and the
South, relative to the admission of Missouri into the Union; the
equally fierce contest respecting the Tariff in 1832-33; the Mexican
War, and the acquisition of vast territory, by the dismemberment
of a foreign empire, which led to the most violent and
angry of all the quarrels between the two sections; constitute the
fourth, fifth and sixth crises in the stormy history of the United
Sections. The seventh and last great crisis, grew out of the repeal
of the Missouri Compromise of 1820, the rise of the Republican
party, as it is called; and consisted in the secession of the
Southern States, and the war of coercion. Each of these seven
crises had, of course, its prelude and its sequel, without which it
cannot be comprehended, or seen how it followed the preceding,
and how it led to the succeeding crises in the chain of events.
Now some of these crises are most imperfectly understood
by the public, and, in some respects, most perfectly misunderstood,
such as the first two for example; others, and especially
the fourth, or the great Compromise of 1820, are overlaid
with a mass of lying traditions such as the world has seldom seen;
traditions invented by politicians, and industriously propagated
by the press and the pulpit. If these traditions were cleared
away, and the facts which lie beneath them in the silent records
of the country brought to view, the revelation would be sufficient
to teach both sections of the Union the profoundest lessons of
humiliation and sorrow. If patiently and properly studied, the
history of the United States is, perhaps, fraught with as many
valuable lessons for the warning and instruction of mankind, as
that of any other age or nation since the fall of Rome, since the
Flood, or since the fall of man.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="RICHARD_H_MENEFEE" id="RICHARD_H_MENEFEE">RICHARD H. MENEFEE</a></h2>


<p>Richard Hickman Menefee, who with Henry Clay and
Thomas F. Marshall form the great triumvirate of early
Kentucky orators, was born at Owingsville, Kentucky,
December 4, 1809. He was educated at Transylvania
University, and graduated from the law school of that institution
in 1832. He practiced his profession at Mt.
Sterling, Kentucky, for several years, when, in 1836, he
was elected to the Kentucky legislature. In the legislature
he won a wide reputation as an orator, and rapidly
became known as the most gifted man of his age in Kentucky.
In the summer of 1837 Menefee made the race for
Congress and, after an exciting campaign, it was found
that he had defeated his opponent, Judge Richard French.
In the lower House of Congress Menefee and Sargeant S.
Prentiss of Mississippi were the two young men that compelled
the country's attention and admiration as orators.
In 1838 William J. Graves, a Kentucky member of the
House, killed Jonathan Cilley, representative from a
Maine district, and the friend of Nathaniel Hawthorne,
in a duel near Washington City. Menefee was one of
Graves's seconds. This affair of honor was so bitterly
condemned on all sides that Congress was compelled to
enact the anti-duelling law. In July, 1838, the people of
Boston tendered Daniel Webster a great home-coming
banquet, in Faneuil Hall, and Menefee responded very eloquently
to a toast to Kentucky. One more session of Congress
and he returned to Kentucky, entering upon the
practice of law at Lexington, where cases pressed fast
upon him. He met Henry Clay in the great Rogers will
case of 1840, and Clay got the jury's verdict. Cassius M.
Clay placed Menefee in nomination for the United States
Senate in the Kentucky legislature of 1841, but his ill-health
made his election a hazardous action. A short time
before his death he drew up the mature reflections of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
life, in the form of a diary, and this, only recently published,
has added to his fame. Menefee died at Lexington,
Kentucky, February 20, 1841. Thomas P. Marshall pronounced
an eulogy upon him which has taken its rightful
place among the masterpieces of American oratory; and
in 1869 a Kentucky county was carved out of several other
counties and named in his honor. While he was not a constructive
statesman, Menefee's fame as an orator seems
to grow greater with the passing of the years.</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>Richard Hickman Menefee</i>, by John Wilson Townsend (New York,

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chairman</span>:</p>

<p>I cannot remain silent under the sentiment which has just been
announced and so enthusiastically received. That sentiment relates
not to myself but to Kentucky&mdash;dearer to me than self.
Of Kentucky I have nothing to say. There she is. In her history,
from the period when first penetrated by the white man as
the <i>dark and bloody ground</i>, down to the present, she speaks.
The character to which that history entitles her is before the
world. She is proud of it. She is proud of the past; she is
proud of the present. And her pride is patriotic and just. As
one of her sons, I ask to express in her name, the acknowledgments
due to the complimentary notice you have taken of her, a
notice not the less complimentary from its association with the
name of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>There is much in the character and history of Massachusetts
which should bind her in the strongest bonds to Kentucky. Your
sentiment places them together: just where they ought to be.
Kentucky is willing to occupy the place you have assigned her.
Without respect now to subordinate differences in past events,
both States stand knit together by the highest and strongest motives
by which States can be impelled. I mean the motive and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
purpose common to each of maintaining and upholding, in every
extremity and to the very last, the Union of these States and the
Constitution. Massachusetts has proclaimed over and over again
her resolution not to survive them. Nor will Kentucky survive
them. She has embarked her whole destiny&mdash;all she has and all
she hopes for&mdash;in the Union and the Constitution. Let come
what may of public calamity, of faction, of sectional seduction
or intimidation, or evil in any form the most dreadful to man,
Kentucky, like Massachusetts, regards the overthrow of the Union
as more frightful than all. Kentucky acknowledges no justification
for a disruption of the Union that is not a justification for
revolution itself. In that Union, and under that Constitution,
Kentucky means to stand or fall. Kentucky stands by the Union
in her living efforts; she means to hold fast to it in her expiring
groans. With Massachusetts she means to perish, if perish she
must, with hands clenched, in death, upon the Union.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>If the occasion allowed it, I should like to say something of old
Massachusetts. I should like to rekindle my own patriotism at
her altars. Here&mdash;on this very spot&mdash;in this very hall&mdash;the
sacred flame of revolutionary liberty first ascended. Here it has
ever ascended. It has never been smothered&mdash;never dimmed.
Perpetual&mdash;clear&mdash;holy! Behold its inspirations here in your
midst! Where are the doctrines of the Union and the Constitution
so incessantly inculcated as here? Where are those doctrines
so enthusiastically adopted as here? The principles of the
Union and the Constitution&mdash;for us another name for the principles
of liberty which cannot survive their overthrow&mdash;will, in
after ages, trace with delight their lineage through you. The
blood of freedom is here pure. To be allied to it is to be ennobled.
<i>Massachusetts!</i> Which of her multitude of virtues
shall I commend? How can I discriminate? I will not attempt
it. I take her as she is and all together&mdash;I give&mdash;<i>Old Massachusetts!</i>
God bless her!</p>

<h2><a name="GEORGE_W_CUTTER" id="GEORGE_W_CUTTER">GEORGE W. CUTTER</a></h2>


<p>George Washington Cutter, one of Kentucky's finest
poets, was born in Massachusetts about 1809, but he early
came to Covington, Kentucky, and entered upon the practice
of his profession, the law. He commanded a company
of Kentuckians in the Mexican War with great honor
to himself and to them. He had been a constant contributor
of verse to the periodicals of his time, but he did not
publish his first book until after the war with Mexico.
<i>Buena Vista and Other Poems</i> (Cincinnati, 1848) was his
first collection, and it contained a preface signed from
Covington, Kentucky, December, 1847. From this it will
be seen that Cutter returned to Kentucky after the war,
and that he was living in this State at the time of his
book's appearance. Tradition has said that he wrote the
title-poem, <i>Buena Vista</i>, a spirited war ballad, on the field
of action immediately after the battle. His little volume
contained thirty-seven poems, including <i>The Song of
Steam</i>, which has been singled out by critics as his masterpiece,
an ode to Henry Clay, his political idol, and his fine
descriptive poem, <i>The Creation of Woman</i>. This, to the
present writer, is the most exquisite thing Cutter did in
verse. It is highly and consistently poetical, and it should
be better appreciated than it has been. Cutter was married
to Mrs. Frances Ann Drake, a famous Kentucky actress,
but they were not happy and a separation by mutual
agreement subsequently followed. Mrs. Cutter was the
widow of Alexander Drake, of the well-known family of
that name, and after parting with the poet she resumed
her first husband's name, returned to the stage, and managed
theatres in Kentucky and Ohio until her death in
Oldham county, Kentucky, September 1, 1875. Cutter
later removed to Indiana and was a member of the State
legislature, after which service he removed to Washington
City to accept a government position. In Washington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
Cutter continued his poetical output, life in the capital
turning his attention to patriotic subjects. <i>Poems, National
and Patriotic</i> (Philadelphia, 1857) proved the author
to be, for the critics of his time, "the most intensely
patriotic poet we have." This volume contained sixty-nine
of what he regarded as his best poems. <i>The Song
of Steam and Other Poems</i> also appeared in this same
year of 1857, and it contained one of the poet's finest
efforts, <i>The Song of the Lightning</i>. Cutter died at Washington,
D. C., December 24, 1865.</p>

<h2><a name="MARTIN_J_SPALDING" id="MARTIN_J_SPALDING">MARTIN J. SPALDING</a></h2>


<p>Martin John Spalding, seventh archbishop of Baltimore,
was born near Lebanon, Kentucky, May 23, 1810. His
forebears were Maryland Catholics who had emigrated to
Kentucky. He was graduated from St. Mary's College
when but sixteen years of age. Spalding then spent four
years at St. Joseph's College, Bardstown, Kentucky, and
the same number of years in Rome, at the conclusion of
which he is said to have made a seven hours' defense in
Latin of 256 theological propositions. This exhibition won
him a doctor's diploma, and his ordination as a priest.
From 1834 to 1843 Dr. Spalding was president of St.
Joseph's College in Bardstown. And from 1843 to 1848
he was in charge of the cathedral at Louisville. In 1848 he
was consecrated Bishop of Lengone; and two years later
Bishop of Louisville. Bishop Spalding served in this capacity
until 1864 when, in the presence of four thousand
people, he was installed as the seventh archbishop of Baltimore.
This high office he held until his death, which occurred
at Baltimore, February 7, 1872. Bishop Spalding
was the greatest Roman Catholic reviewer and historian
Kentucky has produced. He was one of the editors of the
<i>Catholic Magazine</i>, and the author of the excellent
<i>Sketches of the Early Catholic Missions in Kentucky</i>
(Louisville, 1846); <i>The Life, Times, and Character of
the Rt. Rev. B. J. Flaget</i> (Louisville, 1852). He also published
<i>Lectures on the General Evidences of Christianity</i>
(1844); <i>Review of D'Aubigne's History of the Reformation</i>
(Baltimore, 1847); <i>History of the Protestant Reformation</i>
(1860); and a posthumous volume, <i>Miscellanea</i>
(1885). There is also a uniform five volume edition of his
works, which is fortunate, as his books, especially the
<i>Sketches</i>, and <i>Flaget</i>, are exceedingly scarce.</p>

<p class="center">A BISHOP'S ARRIVAL</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>Sketches of the Life, Times, and Character of the Rt. Rev. Benedict
Joseph Flaget</i> (Louisville, Kentucky, 1852)]</p>

<p>Bishop Dubourg had sailed from Bordeaux on the 1st of July,
1817; and he had landed at Annapolis on the 4th of September.
His <i>suite</i> consisted of five priests&mdash;of whom the present Archbishop
of New Orleans was one&mdash;and twenty-six young men,
some of whom were candidates for the ministry, and others were
destined to become lay brothers to assist the missionaries in temporal
affairs. Several of these youths were from Belgium; and
among them was the V. Rev. D. A. Deparcq, of our Diocese. A
portion of the company started directly for Baltimore with
Bishop Dubourg; the rest, with the Rev. M. Blanc at their head,
remained at Annapolis, where they were entertained with
princely hospitality in the mansion of Charles Carroll of Carrollton,
until the end of October.</p>

<p>Preparations were in the meantime made for crossing the
mountains. The stage then ran westward only once a week; and
no less than three weeks were consumed in transporting the missionary
band to Pittsburgh. The Bishop and M. Blanc were
in the last division; but after remaining in the stage for two
days, during which time it had repeatedly upset, endangering
their lives, they finally abandoned it altogether, and performed
the remainder of the journey for five days on foot. About the
middle of November, the missionary company embarked on a flatboat;
and they reached Louisville on the last day of the month.
Here they found the Rev. MM. Chabrat and Shaeffer, who had
been sent on by Bishop Flaget to welcome them to Kentucky.
Accompanied by them and by the Rev. M. Blanc, Bishop Dubourg
started immediately for St. Thomas's, where he arrived in
the evening of December 2d.</p>

<p>Bishop Flaget was rejoiced to meet his old friend. "I recognized
him instantly," says he; "see! on meeting me, he has the
humility to dismount, in order to present me the most affectionate
salute that ever was given." Many and long were the "happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
conversations" which he held with his former associate, and now
distinguished guest. Bishop Dubourg officiated pontifically, and
preached an admirable sermon in the church of St. Thomas,&mdash;the
only cathedral which the Bishop as yet possessed.</p>

<p>On the 12th of December, the two prelates, accompanied by
Father Badin, set out for St. Louis, by the way of Louisville.
Here Bishop Dubourg preached in the chapel erected by M.
Badin. On the 18th they embarked on the steamboat Piqua, and
on the 20th reached the mouth of the Ohio, where they were detained
five days by the ice. Their time was passed chiefly in religious
exercises and pious conversations.</p>

<p>The following description of the Piqua and its passengers,
from the pen of Bishop Flaget, may not be uninteresting to us
at the present day, when steamboat building and navigation have
so greatly changed for the better:</p>

<p>"Nothing could be more original than the medley of persons
on board this boat. We have a band of seven or eight comedians,
a family of seven or eight Jews, and a company of clergymen
composed of a tonsured cleric, a priest, and two Bishops; besides
others, both white and black. Thus more than thirty persons
are lodged in an apartment (cabin), twenty feet by twelve, which
is again divided into two parts. This boat comprises the old and
the new testament. It might serve successively for a synagogue,
a cathedral, a theatre, an hospital, a parlor, a dining room, and a
sleeping apartment. It is, in fact, a veritable <i>Noah's ark</i>, in
which there are both clean and unclean animals;&mdash;and what is
more astonishing,&mdash;peace and harmony reign here."</p>

<p>They were still at the mouth of the Ohio on the morning of
Christmas day. Not being able to say three Masses, they determined
to make three meditations. At the conclusion of the second,
the redoubtable Piqua resumed her course towards St. Louis.
The Bishops and clergy made a kind of retreat on their Noah's
ark. On the evening of Christmas day, the boat stopped near the
farm of the widow Fenwick, a good Catholic, whom they were
happy to visit. M. Badin continued his journey by land from
this point, in order to be able to visit on the way many of his old
friends, Catholic emigrants from Kentucky.</p>

<p>The Bishops returned to the boat, where they found the comedians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
performing a play,&mdash;that is, engaged in a general fight
among themselves,&mdash;until they were separated by the captain.
At midnight, on the 30th, they arrived at St. Genevieve; and
early next morning they sent a messenger to announce their coming
to M. De Andreis.</p>

<p>Two hours afterwards, "about thirty of the principal inhabitants
came, with several young men on horseback and a carriage,
to escort the Bishops into the town. We went to the presbytery
to put on our pontifical robes: twenty-four choir-children with
the cross at their head, and four citizens bearing a canopy, conducted
us to the church, where after the installation of Bishop
Dubourg, on a throne specially prepared for the purpose, we
sang the <i>Te Deum</i>. The whole day was spent in receiving visits."</p>

<p>On the first day of the year 1818, Bishop Dubourg celebrated
Pontifical Mass at St. Genevieve. The journey was then continued
to Prairie du Rocher and Cahokias to St. Louis, where the
prelates arrived on the 5th. They were received with great
pomp, in the best French style; and Bishop Dubourg was no
sooner known than he was universally esteemed and beloved. He
professed himself much pleased with the dispositions and sentiments
of his new flock,&mdash;so different from what he had been led
to expect.</p>

<p>Bishop Flaget having now completed his mission, preached his
farewell sermon to the Catholics of St. Louis on the feast of the
Epiphany; and on the next day he turned his face homeward.
He and M. Badin performed the journey on horseback, by the
way of Kaskaskia and Vincennes. They were detained three days
at the former place, not being able to cross the river in consequence
of the running ice; and in traversing Illinois they passed
three successive nights in the open air of the prairies. They
reached Vincennes on the 27th of January; and after remaining
here two weeks, attending to missionary duties, they continued
their journey.</p>

<p>On the 21st of February, the Bishop found himself once more
at his retired and pleasant home in the seminary of St. Thomas.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="JOHN_W_AUDUBON" id="JOHN_W_AUDUBON">JOHN W. AUDUBON</a></h2>


<p>John Woodhouse Audubon, son of the great Audubon,
was born at Henderson, Kentucky, November 30, 1812.
At the time of his birth his father was ekeing out an existence
in Henderson, with saw-mills and lumber ventures
of various kinds, all of which finally failed. The nomadic
life of the ornithologist was early forced upon his son.
Their wanderings were chiefly confined to the country
south of the Ohio river, and Louisiana. John Woodhouse
Audubon was instructed by his mother in the useful field
of learning; but from his father he learned to delineate
birds and mammals, though it was the family's desire that
he should become a portrait painter. He and his brother,
Victor, who was three years his elder, were sent to school
together, but, in 1826, they were separated, Victor becoming
a clerk at Louisville, Kentucky, and John remaining
in Louisiana with his mother, who was then conducting
a school, while the father went to Europe to solicit subscriptions
for his forthcoming <i>Birds of America</i>. John
W. Audubon was at this time engaged in drawing from
Nature, and in playing the violin, to which he was devoted
throughout life. He was a clerk for a short time on a
Mississippi river steamboat, but any kind of routine was
distasteful to him, his whole life being absorbed in the
study of birds and mammals. He accompanied his father
on one of his European trips, and in England and Scotland
he copied many of the masterpieces of the great
painters. In 1863 the collection of new species demanded
that father and son should go as far South as the Gulf of
Mexico; and while passing through Charleston, South
Carolina, the son met Maria Bachman, whom he married
the following year. In 1840 the Audubon house near New
York City was built, and there John W. Audubon spent
the remaining years of his life. In 1849 he joined a California
company to go to the gold fields, but he went not for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
gold but for new birds and mammals. He returned in the
following year, and in 1851, his famous father died. The
brothers were then occupied with the publication of <i>The
Quadrupeds</i>, and the octavo edition of <i>The Birds of America</i>.
In the summer of 1860 Victor Audubon died; and on
February 21, 1862, his brother followed him into the silent
country. John Woodhouse Audubon's forty-nine years
were spent in collaborating with his father and brother,
but his independent fame is founded upon the manuscript
record of his 1849 journey from New York to California.
This most interesting manuscript was edited by his daughter,
Miss Maria R. Audubon, of Salem, New York, and
published as <i>Audubon's Western Journal: 1849-1850</i>
(Cleveland, Ohio, 1906). A more charming book of travels,
of Nature in many forms, would be difficult to name.</p>

Americans are pouring in, and in a few years will make a beautiful

in irrigating ditches like those at San Antonio de Bexar. The
whole town is surrounded to the south with very luxuriant vines,
and the grapes are quite delightful; we parted from them with
great regret, as fruit is such a luxury with us. Many of the men
took bushels, and only paid small sums for them.</p>

mountains on the east of the Tulare valley. Here, for the first
time, I saw the Lewis woodpecker, and Steller's jay in this country.
I have seen many California vultures and a new hawk,
with a white tail and red shoulders. During the dry season this
great plain may be travelled on, but now numerous ponds and
lakes exist, and the ground is in places, for miles, too boggy to
ride over, so we were forced to skirt the hills. This compelled
us sometimes to take three days when two should have been
ample. Our journeys now are not more than twenty miles a day,
and our nights are so penetrating and cold, that four blankets
are not too many.</p>

of them, and men of the lowest types, more blasphemous,
and with less regard for God and his commands than all I have
ever seen on the Mississippi, [in] New Orleans or Texas, which
give us the same class to some extent, it is true; but instead of a
few dozen, or a hundred, gaming at a time, here there are thousands,
and one house alone pays one hundred and fifty thousand

<h2><a name="ADRIEN_E_ROUQUETTE" id="ADRIEN_E_ROUQUETTE">ADRIEN E. ROUQUETTE</a></h2>


<p>Adrien Emmanuel Rouquette, Louisiana's most distinguished
poet, was born at New Orleans, February 13, 1813,
the scion of an old and honorable Creole family, and the
brother of Francois Dominique Rouquette (1810-1890),
who was also a poet of much merit. From his boyhood
he had a great fancy for the American Indian, and among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
them he spent many of his early years. His academic
training was begun at Transylvania University of Lexington,
Kentucky, but as the old matriculation books have
disappeared, it now seems quite impossible to definitely
fix his period of residence. From Lexington Rouquette
journeyed to Paris, France, where he studied at the Royal
College and at Nantes and Remnes. He was graduated
from Remnes, March 26, 1833, and at once returned to New
Orleans. He had, however, developed into such an unconventional
fellow his family decided that a law course
in Paris was what he needed, so back to the capital of the
French he went. He soon abandoned the law and again
returned to New Orleans, where he took up his abode
among the Indians. In 1841 Rouquette published his
first and best book of poems, written wholly in French, entitled
<i>Les Savanes</i> (Paris and New Orleans). Nearly all
of the poems were upon Louisiana subjects, save the finest
one, <i>Souvenir de Kentucky</i>, an exquisite memorial of his
Kentucky days, written in 1838. As he was partly educated
in Kentucky and in praise of Kentucky wrote his
masterpiece, this State has a double claim upon him which,
though secondary to that of Louisiana, is none the less legitimate.
In 1842 the poet began his studies for the priesthood,
and three years later he was ordained and attached to the
Catholic cathedral at New Orleans. His subsequent works
include <i>Discours prononce a la Cathedral de Saint Louis</i>
(New Orleans, 1846); <i>Wild Flowers</i> (New Orleans, 1848);
<i>La Thebaide en Amerique</i> (New Orleans, 1852); <i>L'Antoniade</i>
(New Orleans, 1860), a long poem in which a solitary
life is extolled; <i>Poemes patriotiques</i> (New Orleans, 1860);
<i>St. Catherine Tegehkwitha</i> (New Orleans, 1873); and, <i>La
Nouvelle Atala</i> (New Orleans, 1879). In 1859 the Abb
Rouquette established a mission for the Choctaw Indians
on the Bayou Lacombe, to which work he gave the larger
part of his life. Rouquette also turned into French the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
poems of Estelle Anna Lewis (1824-1880), the Baltimore
woman whom Poe admired; and he edited <i>Selections from
the Poets of all Countries</i>. The three great Louisiana
writers, Rouquette, the poet, Fortier, the critic, and Gayarr,
the historian, published pamphlets condemnatory of
Mr. George W. Cable's conceptions of Creole life and history
as set forth in his many books. The Abb sent his out
anonymously, entitled <i>Critical Dialogue between Aboo
and Caboo on a New Book, or a Grandissime Ascension</i>,
edited by E. Junius (Great Publishing House of Sam Slick
Allspice, 12 Veracity street, Mingo City, 1880). From
the Creole standpoint <i>The Grandissimes</i> most probably
deserved to be satirized, but not in the cheap and easy
manner of this little pamphlet. It was a very unhappy
swan-song of senility for the Abb Rouquette. He died
at New Orleans, July 15, 1887, lamented by his city and
state. Sainte-Beuve, though recognizing the influence of
Chateaubriand in Rouquette's work, praised him highly,
as did many of the other famous French critics of his day
and generation.</p>

<h2><a name="EMILY_V_MASON" id="EMILY_V_MASON">EMILY V. MASON</a></h2>


<p>Miss Emily Virginia Mason, biographer and anthologist,
was born at Lexington, Kentucky, October 15, 1815, the
sister of Stevens Thompson Mason, first governor of
Michigan. She was educated in Kentucky schools and in
a female seminary at Troy, New York. From 1845 until
1861 Miss Mason lived in Fairfax county, Virginia, but
when the Civil War began she left her home and volunteered
in the Confederate States hospital service; and she
was matron successively of hospitals in the Virginia towns
of Greenbrier, White Sulphur Springs, Charlottesville,
Lynchburg, and Richmond. Miss Mason won a wide reputation
in this work, becoming one of the best loved of
Southern women. Almost immediately after the war her
first literary work was published, an anthology of <i>The
Southern Poems of the War</i> (Baltimore, 1867) which was
one of the first collection issued of verse which owed its
origin to the war. Her second book was what she always
said was the first life of Lee, though John Esten Cooke's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
account of the great soldier appeared about the same time,
entitled <i>A Popular Life of General Robert Edward Lee</i>
(Baltimore, 1871). This was followed by her edition of
<i>The Journal of a Young Lady of Virginia in 1798</i> (1871),
which enjoyed wide popularity among Virginians of her
generation. Miss Mason went to Paris, France, about
1870, and for the following fifteen years she was associate
principal of an American school for young women. Upon
her return to this country she established herself in an
attractive old Southern home at Georgetown, D. C., in
which she spent the remainder of her life. Miss Mason's
last literary work was <i>Memories of a Hospital Matron</i>,
which appeared in <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i> for September
and October of 1902. She was an able writer and a most
remarkable woman in many respects. Miss Mason died
at Georgetown, D. C., February 16, 1909, at the great age
of ninety-four years.</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>A Popular Life of General Robert E. Lee</i> (Baltimore, 1871)]</p>

<p>On the evening of this day, 28th of September [1870] after a
morning of great fatigue, he attended the vestry meeting referred
to, returned home, and seated at the tea-table, opened his lips
to give thanks to God.</p>

<p>The family looked up to see the parted lips, but heard no sound.
With that last thanksgiving his great heart broke.</p>

<p>For many days his weeping friends hung over him, hoping
for a return of health and reason, but in vain. He murmured
of battles and sieges; of guarded tents and fields just won.
Among his last words were: "Strike my tent! Send for Hill!"
Remarkably coincident with those of his great lieutenant, Jackson,
whose words were: "Let A. P. Hill prepare for action!
March the infantry rapidly to the front! Let us cross the river
and rest under the shade of the trees."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>At 9 o'clock on the morning of the 12th of October, the great
soldier breathed his last.</p>

<p>The following day his body was borne to the college-chapel,
escorted by a guard of honor composed of Confederate soldiers.
Next the hearse was led General Lee's favorite horse "Traveller,"
who had borne him in so many battles. The Trustees and Faculty
of the college, the cadets of the Military Institute, and the
citizens, followed in procession.</p>

<p>Above the chapel floated the flag of Virginia, draped in mourning.</p>

<p>Through this and the succeeding day, the body, covered with
flowers, lay in state, visited by thousands who came to look for
the last time upon his noble features.</p>

<p>On the 15th, the last said rites were rendered, amid the tolling
of the bells, the sound of martial music, and the thundering of
artillery.</p>

<p>The students, officers and soldiers of the Confederate army,
and about a thousand persons, assembled at the chapel. A military
escort, with the officers of General Lee's staff, were in the
front. The hearse followed, with the faithful "Traveller" close
behind it. Next came a committee of the Virginia Legislature,
with citizens from all parts of the State. Passing the Military
Institute, the cadets made the military salute as the body appeared,
then joined the procession, and escorted it back to the
chapel.</p>

<p>It had been the request of General Lee that no funeral oration
should be pronounced over his remains. His old and long-tried
friend, the Rev. Wm. N. Pendleton, simply read the burial services
of the Episcopal Church, after which was lowered into a
tomb beneath the chapel all that was mortal of Robert E. Lee.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="EDMUND_FLAGG" id="EDMUND_FLAGG">EDMUND FLAGG</a></h2>


<p>Edmund Flagg, traveler, journalist, and poet, was born
at Wiscasset, Maine, November 24, 1815. Immediately
upon his graduation from Bowdoin College, in 1835, he
removed to Louisville, Kentucky, and became a teacher.
His letters written to the <i>Louisville Journal</i> while traveling
in the states of the Middle West, were afterwards collected,
revised, and published anonymously, entitled <i>The
Far West, or a Tour beyond the Mountains</i> (New York,
1838, two vols.). This work has been edited by Dr. Reuben
Gold Thwaites and published as volumes 26 and 27 of
<i>Early Western Travels</i> (Cleveland, 1906). In 1839 Flagg
became associate editor of the Louisville <i>Literary News-Letter</i>,
of which George D. Prentice was editor. All of
his poems of merit were published in the <i>Journal</i>, and
<i>News-Letter</i>. Flagg contributed both prose and verse to
the Louisville papers for nearly thirty-five years. Ill-health
compelled him to abandon journalism for law, and
at Vicksburg, Mississippi, he formed a partnership with
the celebrated Sargent Smith Prentiss. Two years later
he became editor of the <i>Gazette</i> at Marietta, Ohio. Flagg's
first two novels were issued about this time, entitled <i>Carrero</i>
(New York, 1842), and <i>Francois of Valois</i> (New
York, 1842). He was next editor of a publication at St.
Louis; and in 1849 he was secretary of the American
legation at Berlin. In 1850-1851 he was United States
consul at Venice. He afterwards returned to St. Louis
and to journalism. Two of his plays, <i>Blanche of Artois</i>,
and <i>The Howard Queen</i>, were well received at Louisville,
Cincinnati, and several other cities. In 1853 Flagg's
<i>Venice, the City of the Sea</i>, appeared, and it won him a
wide reputation. <i>North Italy since 1849</i>, issued some
years later, resumed the story of Venice where his first
work had left off, and brought it down to date. Flagg
was afterwards connected with the State department in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
Washington, and under an order from Congress he prepared
his famous <i>Report on the Commercial Relations of
the United States with all Foreign Nations</i> (Washington,
1856-1857, four vols.). His final work was a novel, <i>De
Molai, the Last of the Military Templars</i> (1888). Edmund
Flagg died at Salem, Virginia, in 1890. He is most certainly
a Kentucky poet, journalist, and traveler, but his
fame as a dramatist, historian, and novelist belongs
wholly to other states.</p>

<p class="center">THE ANCIENT MOUNDS OF THE WEST</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>The Louisville Literary News-Letter</i>]</p>

<p>Ages since&mdash;long ere the first son of the Old World had
pressed the fresh soil of the New&mdash;long before the bright region
beyond the blue waves had become the object of the philosopher's
reverie by day, and the enthusiast's vision by night&mdash;in
the deep stillness and solitude of an unpeopled land, these vast
mausoleums rose as they now rise, in lonely grandeur from the
plain and looked down even as now they look, upon the giant
floods rolling their dark waters at their base, hurrying past them
to the deep. So has it been with the massive tombs of Egypt,
amid the sands and barrenness of the desert. For ages untold
have the gloomy pyramids been reflected by the inundations of
the Nile; an hundred generations, they tell us, have arisen from
the cradle, and reposed beneath their shadows, and like autumn
leaves have dropped into the grave; but, from the midnight of
bygone centuries, comes forth no darting spirit to claim these
kingly sepulchres as his own! And shall the dusky piles, on the
plains of distant Egypt affect so deeply our reverence for the
departed, and these mighty monuments, reposing in dark sublimity
upon our own magnificent prairies, vailed in mystery more
inscrutable than they, call forth no solitary throb? Is there no
hallowing interest associated with these aged relics&mdash;these tombs,
and temples, and towers' of another race, to elicit emotion? Are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
they indeed to us no more than the dull clods we tread upon?
Why then does the wanderer from the far land gaze upon them
with wonder and veneration? Why linger fondly around them,
and meditate upon the power which reared them, and is departed?
Why does the poet, the man of genius and fancy, or
the philosopher of mind and nature, seat himself at their base,
and with strange and undefined emotions, pause and ponder,
amid the loneliness that slumbers around? And surely, if the far
traveler, as he wanders through this Western Valley, may linger
around these aged piles, and meditate upon a power departed&mdash;a
race obliterated&mdash;an influence swept from the earth forever&mdash;and
dwell with melancholy emotions upon the destiny of man,
is it not meet, that those into whose keeping they seem by Providence
consigned, should regard them with interest and emotion?&mdash;that
they should gather up and preserve every incident relevant
to their origin, design, or history, which may be attained,
and avail themselves of every measure, which may give to them
perpetuity, and hand them down, undisturbed in form or character,
to other generations?</p>

<p>That these venerable piles are of the workmanship of man's
hand, no one, who with unprejudiced opinion has examined them,
can doubt. But with such an admission, what is the cloud of
reflections, which throng and startle the mind? What a series
of unanswerable inquiries succeed! When were these enormous
earth heaps reared up from the plain? By what race of beings
was the vast undertaking accomplished? What was their purpose?&mdash;what
changes in their form and magnitude have taken
place?&mdash;what vicissitudes and revolutions have, in the lapse of
centuries, rolled like successive waves over the plains at their
base? As we reflect, we anxiously look around us for some tradition&mdash;some
time-stained chronicle&mdash;some age-worn record&mdash;even
the faintest and most unsatisfactory legend, upon which to
repose our credulity, and relieve the inquiring solicitude of the
mind. But our research is hopeless. The present race of Aborigines
can tell nothing of these tumuli. To them as to us they
are vailed in mystery. Ages since&mdash;long ere the white-face
came&mdash;while this fair land was yet the home of his fathers&mdash;the
simple Indian stood before the venerable earth-heap, and
gazed, and wondered, and turned away.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CATHERINE_A_WARFIELD" id="CATHERINE_A_WARFIELD">CATHERINE A. WARFIELD</a></h2>


<p>Mrs. Catherine Ann Warfield, poet and novelist, was
born at Natchez, Mississippi, June 6, 1816, the daughter
of Nathaniel H. Ware. She was educated at Philadelphia
with her sister, Eleanor P. Ware Lee (1820-1849), with
whom she afterwards collaborated in her first two volumes.
Catherine Ware was married at Cincinnati, in
1833, to Robert Elisha Warfield, of Lexington, Kentucky,
and Kentucky was her home henceforth. <i>The Wife of
Leon, and Other Poems, by Two Sisters of the West</i> (New
York, 1844), and <i>The Indian Chamber, and Other Poems</i>
(New York, 1846) were the works of the sisters. In 1857
Mrs. Warfield removed from Lexington to Pewee Valley,
Kentucky, near Louisville, and some three years later her
masterpiece appeared, entitled <i>The Household of Bouverie</i>
(New York, 1860, two vols.). This work brought her into
wide notice. During the Civil War Mrs. Warfield wrote
some of the most spirited lyrics which that mighty conflict
called forth. After the war she turned again to
prose fiction, producing the following books: <i>The Romance
of the Green Seal</i> (1867); <i>Miriam Monfort</i> (1873);
<i>A Double Wedding</i> (1875); <i>Hester Howard's Temptation</i>
(1875); <i>Lady Ernestine</i> (1876); <i>Miriam's Memoirs</i>
(1876); <i>Sea and Shore</i> (1876); <i>Ferne Fleming</i> (1877);
and her last novel, <i>The Cardinal's Daughter</i> (1877). Mrs.
Warfield died at Pewee Valley, Kentucky, May 21, 1877,
at the time of her greatest popularity. Of her books <i>The
Household of Bouverie</i> is the only one that is generally
known to-day, and is, perhaps, the only one that is at all
readable and interesting. Mrs. Warfield was an early
edition of "The Duchess" and Mary Jane Holmes, though
she did write fine war lyrics and one good story, which is
just a bit better than either of the other two women did.</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>The Household of Bouverie</i> (New York, 1860, v. ii)]</p>

<p>Another queer scene with little Paul, whose quaint ways divert
and mystify me all the time. During Mr. Bouverie's absence of
a week, I have nothing else to amuse me nor to write about. He
has called me familiarly "Camilla" until now; but fearing that
Mr. Bouverie might not like the appellation, or rather that it
might make me appear too childish in his sight, I said to him
recently:</p>

<p>"Paul, you are a little fellow, and I am your guardian's wife.
Don't you think it would sound better if you were to add a
handle to my name, as common folks say? Call me 'Cousin Camilla'
or 'Aunt Camilla,' whichever you prefer; which shall it
be, Quintil?"</p>

<p>"Neither," he replied, manfully, "for you are neither of those
things to me, and I do not like to tell stories; but I will call you 'madam,' if you choose, as you are a 'madam;'" and something
like a sneer wreathed his childish lips.</p>

<p>"A foolish little madam, you think, Paul!" I rejoined, half
in pique, half in playfulness.</p>

<p>"Why that is the very name for you," he said, brightening
with the thought. "'Little Madam!' I will call you so; but I
will not put in the foolish," he added, gravely, "for, perhaps,
you will change after a while and grow wiser."</p>

<p>He spoke very seriously, sorrowfully almost, and I was quite
provoked for a moment to be set down in this fashion, by such a
mere babe and suckling. I was glad of the opportunity presented
to me of snubbing him by noticing a streak of molasses on his
cheek.</p>

<p>"Go wash your face, Paul," I said, "it is dirty!"</p>

<p>He walked gravely to the glass and surveyed the stain. "Looking
glasses are useful things, after all," he said; "they tell the
truth&mdash;see 'Little Madam,' how you are mistaken! my face is
not dirty, only soiled; food is not dirt&mdash;if it were, we should all
starve."</p>

<p>He turned and smiled at me in his peculiar way, half mocking,
half affectionate.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yet, as you bid me," he added, "I will wash it off; but isn't
it a pity to waste what would keep a bee alive a whole day!"</p>

<p>Is this brat a humorist?</p>

<p>He has brought out of his funny little trunk the oddest present
for me! It is a Medusa's head admirably carved in alabaster, and
was broken from the side of a vase by accident, and given to him
by a lady, at whose house he made a visit with Mr. Bouverie.</p>

<p>He considers it a priceless treasure. There is a vague horror
to me in the face that is almost insupportable. The snaky hair,
the sightless, glaring eyes, are so mysteriously dreadful. He
says it will answer for a paper weight. No, Paul, I will lay it
away out of sight forever.</p>

<h2><a name="J_ROSS_BROWNE" id="J_ROSS_BROWNE">J. ROSS BROWNE</a></h2>


<p>John Ross Browne, humorist and traveler, was born in
Ireland, in 1817, but when an infant his father came to
America and settled at Louisville, Kentucky. Browne
was educated in the Louisville schools, and studied medicine
for a time under several well-known physicians.
When eighteen years old he went to New Orleans; and
this journey kindled his passion for travel that ended only
with his death. Browne took the whole world for his
home. He first went almost around the globe on a whaling
vessel, and on his return to this country, he published
his first book, called <i>Etchings of a Whaling Cruise</i> (New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
York, 1846). Browne was private secretary for Robert
J. Walker, Secretary of the Treasury, for a time, but, in
1849, he went to California as a government commissioner;
and in 1851 he went to Europe as a newspaper correspondent.
A tour of Palestine is described in Browne's
most famous book, <i>Yusef, or the Journey of the Frangi</i>
(New York, 1853). He shortly afterwards returned to
the United States and became an inspector of customs
on the Pacific coast; but the year of 1861 found him again
in Europe, residing at Frankfort-on-the-Main. Browne's
next work was <i>Crusoe's Island</i> (New York, 1864). His
family's residence in Germany resulted in the author publishing
<i>An American Family in Germany</i> (New York,
1866), one of his most delightful volumes. Browne's
travels in northern Europe are described in <i>The Land of
Thor</i> (New York, 1867). He now returned to America
and made his home in California. He investigated the
mineral resources of the country west of the Rocky Mountains,
and his report was issued as <i>Resources of the Pacific
Slope</i> (1869). <i>Adventures in the Apache Country</i>
(1869), was his last book. Browne was appointed United
States Minister to China on March 11, 1868, but he was
recalled sixteen months later. He died at Oakland, California,
December 9, 1875. Most of his volumes are very
cleverly illustrated with his own comical sketches of characters
and scenes. That J. Ross Browne was a man of
very considerable ability in several directions admits of
no argument.</p>

<p class="center">LAPDOGS IN GERMANY</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>An American Family in Germany</i> (New York, 1866)]</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable sights is the dog-fancier&mdash;a strapping
six-foot dandy, leading after him, with silken strings, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
whole brood of nasty little poodles. This fellow is a type of the
class; you meet them everywhere at every Continental city.
There are thousands of them in Frankfort, men strangely infatuated
on the subject of little dogs. Now pardon me if I devote
some serious reflections to this extraordinary and unreasonable
propensity, which, I fear, is rapidly taking root in the hearts of
the American people, especially the female portion of our population.
In men it is often excusable; they may be driven to it
by unrequited affection. I never see a fine-looking fellow leading
a gang of little poodle-dogs after him, that I don't imagine
he has had some dreadful experience in the line of true love; but
with the opposite sex the case is quite different. "If women
have one weakness more marked than another," says Mrs. Beecher
Stowe, in a very eloquent passage of the "Minister's Wooing,"
"it is toward veneration. They are born worshippers&mdash;makers
of silver shrines for some divinity or other, which, of
course, they always think fell straight down from heaven." And,
in illustration of this very just remark, she refers to instances
where celebrated preachers and divines have stood like the image
that Nebuchadnezzar the king set up, "and all womankind, coquettes
and flirts not excepted, have been ready to fall down and
worship, even before the sound of cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, and
so forth," where the most gifted and accomplished of the sex
"have turned away from the flattery of admirers, to prostrate
themselves at the feet of a genuine hero, who never moved them
except by heroic deeds and the rhetoric of a noble life"&mdash;a most
striking and beautiful trait in woman's character to which all
homage should be rendered. She clingeth unto man, even as the
ivy clingeth unto the oak. But does anybody pretend to tell me
that man is always the lucky recipient of this devotion? Alas,
no! Not always for him is it that women are burdened with this
load of "fealty, faith, and reverence more than they know what
to do with;" not always for him is it that "They stand like a
hedge of sweet peas, throwing out fluttering tendrils everywhere
for something high and strong to climb by." Alas! man is but
a cipher among the objects of woman's heroic devotion. I have
a lady in my eye who from early youth has bestowed the tenderest
affections of her heart upon poll-parrots; another, who for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
years has wept over the woes of a little chicken; who would abandon
her midnight slumber to minister to the afflictions of a lame
turkey, and insensible to the appeals of her lover, only relax in
her severity when moved by the plaintive mewing of a cat; another,
who, in the bosom of her family, and tenderly adored by her
husband, has long since yielded to the fascinating allurement
of a sewing-machine, and wrapped around its cogwheels, cotton
spools, and hammering needles the poetry of a romantic attachment;
and, lastly, the particular case in point, at which I marvel
most of all, three most bewitching young ladies, of acknowledged
beauty, who are hopelessly and irrevocably gone in love with&mdash;what
do you think? Not a man, erect and noble, with the brow
of Jove and eye of Mars; not even a horse, the paragon of beautiful
and intelligent animals, or a lion, the king of the forest; but
a miserable, dirty, nasty, little lapdog; a snappish, foul-eyed
inodorous, sneaking little brute, which even the very cats hold in
contempt! And yet they love it; at least they say so, and I have
no reason to dispute their word. Have I not heard them, morning,
noon, and night, protest their devotion to the dear little Fidel&mdash;the
precious, beautiful little Fidel&mdash;the adorable love of a
little Fidel! Oh, it is enough to make the angels weep to see the
grace and fondness with which this horrid little wretch is caught
up in those tender white arms, and hugged to those virgin bosoms
and kissed by those pouting and honeyed lips! Faugh! It
drives me mad. What is the use of wasting so much sweetness
when there are thousands of good, honest fellows actually pining
away from unrequited affection? brave sons of toil, ready at a
moment's notice to be caressed by these sweet-pea vines, who are
throwing out their fluttering tendrils for something high and
strong to cling to. I leave it to any honest miner, if it is not provoking
to the last degree to see the noblest capacity of woman's
nature thus cruelly and wastefully perverted&mdash;the choicest affections
devoted to a miserable, disgusting, and unsympathizing
little monster&mdash;the very honey of their lips lavished on that foul
and mucous nose, which, if it knows anything, must know some
thing not fit to be mentioned to polite ears. Heaven! how often
have I longed to have a good fair kick at one of these pampered
little brutes. Only think of the care taken of them, while widows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
and orphans are shivering in the cold and perishing of hunger.
The choicest pieces of meat cut up for them, potatoes and gravy
mixed, delicate morsels of bread; the savory mess put before them
by delicate hands, and swallowed into their delicate stomachs,
and too often rejected by those delicate organs, to the detriment
of the carpet. And then, when this delectable subject of woman's
adoration is rubbed, and scrubbed, and pitied, and physicked,
and thoroughly combed out from head to foot, with every
love-lock of his glossy hair filtered of its fleas, how tenderly he is
laid upon the bed or clasped in the embraces of beauty! Shade
of Cupid! what a happy thing it is to be a lapdog! Well might
the immortal Bard of Avon prefer to be a dog that bayed the
moon rather than an indifferent poet. For my part, I'd sooner
be wrapped in the arms of beauty than be King of the Cannibal
Islands. That strange infatuation of feminine instinct which
lends to the head-dress, at an approaching bridal, a degree of
importance to which the expected groom can never aspire; which
sees the destinies of the whole matrimonial career centred in the
fringe of a nightgown; which seeks advice and consolation in the
pattern of a reception-dress; which would shrink from the fearful
sacrifice of liberty but for the magic power of new bonnets, new
gloves, and embroidered handkerchiefs&mdash;that we can all understand;
these are woman's coy devices to tantalize mankind; these
are the probationary tortures inflicted upon him through mere
wantonness and love of mischief. But when the richest treasures
of her affection, the most divine essence of her being, the Promethean
spark warm from her virgin heart, for which worlds are
lost and won&mdash;when these are cast away upon a nauseous little
lapdog, ye gods! what can poor mortals do but abandon their
humanity! It is shocking to think of such competition, but how
can we help it if young ladies give themselves up to dog worship?
I sincerely trust this Continental fashion may never take root in
California. Should it do so, farewell all hope for the honest sons
of toil; it will then be the greatest of good fortunes to be born a
lapdog!</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="ROB_MORRIS" id="ROB_MORRIS">ROB MORRIS</a></h2>


<p>Robert Morris, who is generally bracketed with Albert
Pike as the most distinguished writer and craftsman
American Masonry has produced, was born near Boston,
Massachusetts, August 31, 1818. He was made a Mason
in Mississippi, in 1846, and this was the beginning of a
Masonic career almost without parallel in the history of
the fraternity. Morris, of course, received all of the
higher degrees in Masonry, but the most momentous thing
he did as a craftsman was to establish the Order of the
Eastern Star in 1850&mdash;the year he became a Kentuckian.
In September, 1854, while living in southern Kentucky,
Morris wrote his most celebrated poem, entitled <i>The Level
and the Square</i>, which was first published in his magazine,
<i>The American Freemason</i>, of Louisville, Kentucky. Rudyard
Kipling lifted a line from it for his equally famous
poem, <i>The Mother Lodge</i>. Although Morris revised
his lines many times, the original version is far and away
the finest. In 1858 he was elected Grand Master of the
Grand Lodge of Kentucky; and two years later he removed
his residence to La Grange, Kentucky, the little
town with which his fame is intertwined. Morris wrote
several well-known religious songs, <i>Sweet Galilee</i>, being
the best of them. He was the author of many books upon
Masonry, his <i>Lights and Shadows of Freemasonry</i> (Louisville,
1852), being the first work in Masonic belles-lettres.
This was followed by his <i>History of the Morgan Affair</i>
(New York, 1852); <i>Life in the Triangle</i> (1853); <i>The Two
Saints John</i> (1854); <i>Code of Masonic Law</i> (Louisville,
1855), the pioneer work on Masonic jurisprudence; <i>Masonic
Book of American Adoptive Rights</i> (1855); <i>History
of Freemasonry in Kentucky</i> (Frankfort, 1859), his most
important historical work; <i>Synopsis of Masonic Laws</i>
(1859); <i>Tales of Masonic Life</i> (1860); <i>Masonic Odes and
Poems</i> (New York, 1864); <i>Biography of Eli Bruce</i> (1867);<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
<i>Dictionary of Freemasonry</i> (1872); <i>Manual of the Queen
of the South</i> (1876); <i>Knights Templar's Trumpet</i> (1880);
<i>Freemasonry in the Holy Land</i> (New York, 1882), an excellent
work; <i>The Poetry of Freemasonry</i> (New York,
1884), upon the publication of which, the author was invited
to New York City and crowned "The Poet Laureate
of Freemasonry," December 17, 1884; and, <i>Magnum Opus</i>
(1886). Morris was one of the foremost numismatics of
his day and generation in America, his works on this science
being <i>The Twelve Caesars</i>, and <i>Numismatic Pilot</i>.
He was also the author of several works designed especially
for the officers of a Masonic lodge; and he edited in
thirty volumes <i>The Universal Masonic Library</i>, besides
editing from time to time four Masonic magazines. Rob
Morris, to give him the name by which he is best known,
died at La Grange, Kentucky, July 31, 1888.</p>

<h2><a name="AMELIA_B_WELBY" id="AMELIA_B_WELBY">AMELIA B. WELBY</a></h2>


<p>Mrs. Amelia B. Welby, Kentucky's most famous female
poet of the mid-century, was born at St. Michael's, Maryland,
February 3, 1819. When she was fifteen years old
her family removed to Louisville, Kentucky, the city of
her fame. In 1837, George D. Prentice, with his wonderful
nose for finding female verse-makers, added Amelia
to his already long and ever-increasing list. He printed
her first poem in his <i>Journal</i>, and crowned her as the finest
branch of his poetical tree. His declaration that she
possessed the divine afflatus meant nothing, as he had said
the same thing about many another sentimental single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
lady, pining upon the peaks of poesy. But Edgar
Allan Poe and Rufus W. Griswold soon separated her
from the versifiers and placed her among the poets, and
thus her fame has come down to us with fragrance. In
June, 1838, Amelia was married to George Welby, a Louisville
merchant, who also held her to be a poet born in the
purple. Mrs. Welby's verse became well-known and
greatly admired in many parts of the country, and, in
response to numerous requests for a volume of her work,
she collected her <i>Journal</i> verse and published it under the
title of <i>Poems by Amelia</i> (Boston, 1845). A second edition
was published the following year, and by 1860 the volume
was said to be in its seventeenth edition! Robert W. Weir's
illustrated edition of her poems was issued in 1850, and
this is the most desirable form in which her work has been
preserved. These various editions will at once convey
some idea of her great popularity. With Poe, Prentice,
and Griswold singing her praises, and the public purchasing
her poems as rapidly as they could be made into books,
Amelia's fame seemed secure. To-day, however, no one
has read any of her verse save <i>The Rainbow</i>, which has
been set down as her best poem, and she has become essentially
an historical personage, the keepsake of Kentucky
letters. While the greater number of her poems are quite
unreadable, her elegy for Miss Laura M. Thurston, a sister
versifier, is well done and her finest piece of work.
Mrs. Welby died at Louisville, May 3, 1852, when but
thirty-three years of age. Had she lived longer, and the
poetic appreciation of the American people suffered no
change, the heights to which she would have attained can
be but vaguely guessed at.</p>

<span class="i0">The breeze fluttered down and blew open the flowers,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As I threw back my tresses to catch the cool breeze,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Its soft-tinted pinions of purple and gold.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When they saw the fair rainbow, knelt down on the shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sweet hymn ascended, no murmur of prayer,<br /></span>

<h2><a name="CHARLES_W_WEBBER" id="CHARLES_W_WEBBER">CHARLES W. WEBBER</a></h2>


<p>Charles Wilkins Webber, the foremost Kentucky writer
of prose fiction and adventure of the old school, was born
at Russellville, Kentucky, May 29, 1819, the son of Dr.
Augustine Webber, a noted Kentucky physician. In 1838
young Webber went to Texas where he was with the Rangers
for several years. He later returned to Kentucky
and studied medicine at Transylvania University, Lexington,
which he soon abandoned for a brief course at
Princeton Theological Seminary, with the idea of entering
the Presbyterian ministry. A short time afterwards,
however, he settled at New York as a literary man. Webber
was connected with several newspapers and periodicals,
being associate editor of <i>The Whig Review</i> for about
two years. His first book, called <i>Old Hicks, the Guide</i>
(New York, 1848) was followed by <i>The Gold Mines of the</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
<i>Gila</i> (New York, 1849, two vols.). In 1849 Webber organized
an expedition to the Colorado country, but it utterly
failed. Several of his other books were now published:
<i>The Hunter-Naturalist</i> (Philadelphia, 1851); <i>Tales of the
Southern Border</i> (1852; 1853); <i>Texas Virago</i> (1852);
<i>Wild Girl of Nebraska</i> (1852); <i>Spiritual Vampirism</i>
(Philadelphia, 1853); <i>Jack Long, or the Shot in the Eye</i>
(London, 1853), his masterpiece; <i>Adventures with Texas
Rifle Rangers</i> (London, 1853); <i>Wild Scenes in the Forest
and Prairie</i> (London, 1854); and his last book, <i>History of
Mystery</i> (Philadelphia, 1855). In 1855 Webber joined
William Walker's expedition to Central America, and in
the battle of Rivas, he was mortally wounded. He died
at Nicaragua, April 11, 1856, in the thirty-seventh year of
his age. Webber's career is almost as interesting as his
stories. In fact, he put so much of his life into his works
that all of them may be said to be largely autobiographical.</p>

<p class="center">TROUTING ON JESSUP'S RIVER</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>Wild Scenes in the Forest and Prairie, or the Romance of Natural
History</i> (London, 1854)]</p>

<p>"The Bridge" at Jessup's River is well known to sportsmen;
and to this point we made our first flyfishing expedition. The
eyes of Piscator glistened at the thought, and early was he busied
with hasty fingers through an hour of ardent preparation amongst
his varied and complicated tackle. Now was his time for triumph.
In all the ruder sports in which we had heretofore been engaged, I,
assisted by mere chance, had been most successful; but now the
infallible certainty of skill and science were to be demonstrated in
himself, and the orthodoxy of flies vindicated to my unsophisticated
sense.</p>

<p>The simple preparations were early completed; the cooking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
apparatus, which was primitive enough to suit the taste of an
ascetic, consisted in a single frying-pan. The blankets, with the
guns, ammunition, rods, etc., were all disposed in the wagon of
our host, which stood ready at the door. It was a rough affair,
with stiff wooden springs, like all those of the country, and suited
to the mountainous roads they are intended to traverse, rather
than for civilized ideas of comfort. We, however, bounded into
the low-backed seat; and if it had been cushioned to suit royalty,
we could not have been more secure than we were of such comfort
as a backwood sportsman looks for. We soon found ourselves
rumbling, pitching, and jolting, over a road even worse than that
which brought us first to the lake. It seemed to me that nothing
but the surprising docility of the ponies which drew us, could
have saved us, strong wagon and all, from being jolted to atoms.
I soon got tired of this, and sprang out with my gun, determined
to foot it ahead, in the hope of seeing a partridge or red squirrel.</p>

<p>We arrived at the "bridge" about the middle of the afternoon.
There we found an old field called Wilcox's clearing, and, like all
places I had seen in this fine grazing region, it was still well
sodded down in blue grass and clover. Our luggage having been
deposited in the shantee, consisting almost entirely of boards torn
from the old house, which were leaned against the sides of two
forks placed a few feet apart, we set off at once for the falls, a
short distance above. This was merely an initial trial, to obtain
enough for dinner, and find the prognostics of the next day's
sport in feeling the manner of the fish.</p>

<p>At the falls the river is only about fifteen feet wide, though
its average width is from twenty-five to thirty. The water
tumbles over a ledge of about ten feet, at the bottom of which is a
fine hole, while on the surface sheets of foam are whirled round
and round upon the tormented eddies, for the stream has considerable
volume and power.</p>

<p>We stepped cautiously along the ledge, Piscator ahead, and
holding his flies ready for a cast, which was most artistically
made, not without a glance of triumph at me, then preparing to
do the same with the humble angle-worm. The "flies" fall&mdash;I
see the glance of half a dozen golden sides darting at them; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
by this time my own cast is made, and I am fully occupied with
the struggles of a fine trout.</p>

<p>My companion's success was again far short of mine, and seeing
him looking at my trout lying beside me, I said: "Try the
worms, good Piscator&mdash;here they are. This is not the right time
of day for them to take the flies in this river, I judge."</p>

<p>Improving the door of escape thus opened to him, he took off
the flies and used worms with immediate and brilliant success,
which brought back the smile to his face; and he would now and
then as calmly brush away the distracting swarm of flies from
his face, as if they had been mere innocent motes. But later that
evening came a temporary triumph for Piscator. The hole at the
falls was soon exhausted, and we moved down to glean the ripples.
It was nearly sunset, and here the pertinacious Piscator determined
to try the flies again. He cast with three, and instantly
struck two half-pound trout, which, after a spirited play, he
safely landed. Rarely have I seen a prouder look of triumph
than that which glowed on his face as he bade me "look there!"
when he landed them.</p>

<p>"Very fine, Piscator&mdash;a capital feat! but I fear it was an
accident. You will not get any more that way."</p>

<p>"We shall see, sir," said he, and commenced whipping the
water again, but to no avail, while I continued throwing them out
with great rapidity.</p>

<p>I abstained from watching him, for I had no desire to spoil his
evening sport by taunting him to continue his experiment. I
soon observed him throwing out the fish with great spirit again.
I merely shouted to him across the stream&mdash;"the angle-worm
once more, Piscator?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" with a laugh.</p>

<p>As the sun went down the black gnats began to make themselves
felt in their smarting myriads, and we forthwith beat a
hasty retreat to the shantee.</p>

<p>We had taken about ten pounds of trout; and the first procedure,
after reaching the camp, was to build a "smudge," or
smoke-fire, to drive away these abominable gnats, which fortunately
take flight with the first whiff of smoke, and the next was to
prepare the fish for dinner, though not till all had been carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
dressed by the guide, and placed in the cold current of the little
spring near, that they might keep sound. Now came the rousing
fire, and soon some splendid trout were piled upon dishes of fresh
pealed elm bark before us. They were very skillfully cooked, and
no epicure ever enjoyed a feast more thoroughly than we did our
well-flavored and delicious trout, in that rude shantee.</p>

<p>The feast being over, then to recline back upon the fresh couch
of soft spruce boughs, and, with a cigar in mouth, watch the gathering
night-shades brooding lower and more low upon the thick
wild forest in front, far into the depths of which the leaping flames
of our crackling fire go, darting now and then with a revealing
tongue of quick light, and listening to the owl make hoarse answer
to the wolf afar off&mdash;to think of wild passages in a life of adventure
years ago amidst surroundings such as this; with the additional
spice of peril from savages and treacherous foes, and then,
as the hushed life subsides into a stiller mood, see the faces of loved
ones come to you through the darkness, with a smile from out
your distant home, and while it sinks sweetly on your heart, subside
into happy and dream-peopled slumber! "This is bliss!"
the bliss of the shantee to the wearied sportsman! a bliss unattainable
by the toiler, and still more by the lounger of the city.</p>

<p>We were on foot with the sun next morning, and after another
feast, which we appreciated with unpalled appetites, we set off
for some deep spring holes nearly a mile above the falls. The
morning set cloudy, and rain fell piteously for several hours.
But if this change detracted from our sport, it at least served to
give zest to the evening's shelter and repose.</p>

<p>I never felt more delightfully than I did when I sat down to a
fine dinner that evening in the old tavern, and very much of this
pleasurable feeling of entire comfort I attributed to the prompt
use of the cold bath, on reaching our temporary home, wet, weary,
and shivering with cold. This, with a change of clothes, restored
me to a healthy glow of warmth, ready to enjoy whatever our
host might provide.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="DR_L_J_FRAZEE" id="DR_L_J_FRAZEE">DR. L. J. FRAZEE</a></h2>


<p>Dr. Lewis Jacob Frazee, author of a little volume of travels
of considerable charm, was born at Germantown, Kentucky,
August 23, 1819. He was prepared for college at the
Maysville Academy, celebrated as the school at which
young U. S. Grant spent one year. He was graduated
from Georgetown College, Georgetown, Kentucky, in the
class of 1837; and four years later he graduated in the
medical department of the University of Louisville. On
April 9, 1844, Dr. Frazee left Maysville, Kentucky, for a
long sojourn in Europe, spending most of his time in Paris
studying subjects then untaught in this country. He also
visited England and the continent before returning home.
These travels Dr. Frazee related in a book of nearly three
hundred pages, entitled <i>The Medical Student in Europe</i>
(Maysville, Kentucky, 1849), which is now an exceedingly
rare work. The style is natural and clear and exhibits
genuine literary flavor. He settled at Louisville in 1851.
His only other publication was <i>The Mineral Waters of
Kentucky</i> (Louisville, 1872), a brochure. Dr. Frazee
took a keen interest in the Filson Club of Louisville, and
one of his finest papers was read before that organization:
<i>An Analysis of the Personal Narrative of James O. Pattie</i>.
He was sometime professor in the medical school
of the University of Louisville, and in the Kentucky
School of Medicine; and he edited <i>The Transylvania Medical
Journal</i> for several years. Old age found the good
doctor surrendering his practice and professorships to
establish the Louisville Dental Depot, designed to furnish
the local dentists with supplies. He died at Louisville,
Kentucky, August 12, 1905, eleven days before his eighty-sixth
birthday.</p>

<p class="center">HAVRE</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>The Medical Student in Europe</i> (Maysville, Kentucky, 1849)]</p>

<p>Havre is a place of about 25,000 inhabitants, has fine docks,
which are accessible in high tide, and a considerable amount of
shipping. Many of the streets are narrow and crooked, with
narrow sidewalks and in many cases none at all. The houses are
stuccoed, and generally present rather a sombre aspect. Three-fourths
of the women we saw in Havre wore no bonnets, but simply
a cap. Some of them were mounted upon donkeys, with a
large market basket swung down each side of the animal; these
of course were the peasants. My attention was attracted by the
large sumpter horses here, which draw singly from eight to ten
bales of cotton, apparently with considerable ease.</p>

<p>On the day after we arrived at Havre we ascended the hill
which rises at one extremity of the city. The various little winding
pathways up the hill, have on each side massive stone walls,
with now and then a gateway leading to a private residence almost
buried in a thicket of shrubbery and flowers. Upon the hill
are situated some most delightful and elegant mansions, with
grounds beautifully ornamented with shade trees, shrubbery,
flowers and handsome walks. These salubrious retreats have a
double charm when compared with the thronged, narrow, and
noisy streets of the city below. Beyond these <i>Villas</i> were fields
of grass and grain undivided by fences, with here and there a
farm house surrounded by a clump of trees.</p>

<p>In Havre we found delightful cherries and strawberries, as
well as a variety of vegetables; the oysters and fish here though
in abundance are of rather an inferior quality, the oysters are
very small and of a decided copperish taste. At breakfast, which
we took at any hour in the morning that we thought proper, we
ordered such articles as suited our fancy, generally however a
cup of coffee, a beef steak, eggs, an omelet or something of this
sort. We dined about five in the evening upon soups, a variety
of meats and vegetables, well prepared, and a dessert of strawberries
and other fruits, nuts, etc. The meats and vegetables
were not placed upon the table, but each dish was passed around
separately&mdash;the table being cleared and clean plates placed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
each course. We were compelled to eat slowly or wait for some
time upon others.</p>

<p>This would not suit one of our western men who is for doing
everything in a minute, but the plan certainly has its advantages&mdash;one,
of promoting digestion by giving time for the mastication
of the food, and another, of no small moment for an epicure, that
of having things fresh from the oven. My own objection to the
plan was, that I never knew how much of an article to eat, as I
did not know what would next be introduced. Such an objection
fails, of course, in many of the hotels where the bill of fare
is stereotyped, and where with more precision than an almanac-maker
you can foretell every change that will take place during
the ensuing year. Our table was well supplied with wine, which
is used as regularly at dinner as milk by our Kentucky farmers.
When our bill was made out, each item was charged separately,
so much for breakfast, mentioning what it consisted of&mdash;so much
for dinner&mdash;so much per day for a room, so much for each
candle we used, and so on. A French landlord in making out
your bill goes decidedly into minutiae.</p>

<h2><a name="THEODORE_OHARA" id="THEODORE_OHARA">THEODORE O'HARA</a></h2>


<p>Theodore O'Hara, author of the greatest martial elegy
in American literature, was born at Danville, Kentucky,
February 11, 1820. He was the son of Kane O'Hara, an
Irish political exile, and a noted educator in his day and
generation. O'Hara's boyhood days were spent at Danville,
but his family settled at Frankfort when he was a
young man. He was fitted for college by his father,
and his preparation was so far advanced that he was enabled
to join the senior class of St. Joseph's College, a
Roman Catholic institution at Bardstown, Kentucky.
Upon his graduation O'Hara was offered the chair of
Greek, but he declined it in order to study law. In 1845
he held a position in the United States Treasury department<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
at Washington; and a few years later he proved
himself a gallant soldier upon battlefields in Mexico, being
brevetted major for meritorious service. After the
war O'Hara practiced law at Washington for some time;
and he went to Cuba with the Lopez expedition of 1850.
After his return to the United States he edited the Mobile,
Alabama, <i>Register</i> for a time; and he was later editor of
the Frankfort, Kentucky, <i>Yeoman</i>. O'Hara was a public
speaker of great ability, and his address upon William
Taylor Barry, the Kentucky statesman and diplomat, is
one of the climaxes of Southern oratory. During the
Civil War he was colonel of the twelfth Alabama regiment.
After the war Colonel O'Hara went to Columbus,
Georgia, and became a cotton broker. He died near Guerrytown,
Alabama, June 6, 1867. Seven years later his
dust was returned to Kentucky, and re-interred in the
State cemetery at Frankfort. If collected Colonel
O'Hara's poems, addresses, political and literary essays,
and editorials would make an imposing volume. His real
fame rests upon his famous martial elegy, <i>The Bivouac
of the Dead</i>, which he wrote at Frankfort in the summer
of 1847, to remember young Henry Clay, Colonel McKee,
Captain Willis, and the other brave fellows who fell in the
war with Mexico. When their remains were returned to
Frankfort and buried in the cemetery on the hill, Colonel
O'Hara, their old companion in arms, wrote his stately
in memoriam for them. He did not read it over them, as
Ranck and the others have written, but he did publish it in
<i>The Kentucky Yeoman</i>, a Democratic paper of Frankfort.
<i>The Bivouac of the Dead</i> is the greatest single poem ever
written by a Kentucky hand, is matchless, superb, and is
read in the remotest corners of the world. Its opening
lines have been cut deep within memorial shafts in many
military cemeteries. Colonel O'Hara sleeps to-day on the
outer circle of his comrades, one with them in death as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
life, with the lofty military monument, which Kentucky
has erected to commemorate her sons slain in the battles
of the republic, casting its long shadows across his grave.
His elegy in honor of Daniel Boone was written at the
"old pioneer's" grave in the Frankfort cemetery before
his now much-mutilated monument was erected. It was
originally printed in <i>The Kentucky Yeoman</i> for December
19, 1850. Two other poems purporting to be his have
been discovered, but there must be others sealed over and
forgotten in the scattered and broken files of Southern
newspapers and periodicals. So the poet has come down
to us, like he who wrote <i>The Burial of Sir John Moore</i>,
with one slender sheaf under his arm. But it is enough,
enough for both of them.</p>

<p class="center">THE FAME OF WILLIAM T. BARRY</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>Obituary Addresses</i> (Frankfort, Kentucky, 1855)]</p>

<p>On his accession to the Presidency, General Jackson&mdash;with
that discerning appreciation of the most available ability and
worth in his party which characterized him&mdash;called Mr. Barry
into his cabinet to the position of Postmaster General. Here, as
one of the most distinguished of the council of Jackson, during the
greater part of his incumbency, he is entitled to his full share of
the fame of that glorious administration. His health, however,
failing him under the wasting labors of the toilsome department
over which he presided, he was forced to relinquish it before the
administration terminated; and General Jackson, unwilling entirely
to lose the benefit of his able services, appointed him, in
1835, Minister Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary to
Spain, a post in which, while its dignity did not disparage his
civil rank, it was hoped that the lightness of the duties, and the
influence of a genial climate, might serve to renovate his impaired
health. But it was otherwise ordained above. He had reached
Liverpool on the way to his mission, when the great conqueror, at
whose summons the strongest manhood, the noblest virtue, the
proudest genius, and the brightest wisdom must surrender, arrested
his earthly career on the 30th of August, 1835; and here is
all that is left to us of the patriot, the orator, the hero, the statesman,
the sage&mdash;the rest belongs to Heaven and to fame.</p>

<p>Such, fellow-citizens, is a most cursory and feeble memento of
the life and public services of the illustrious man in whose memory
Kentucky has decreed the solemn honors of this day. It is
well for her that she has felt "the late remorse of love," and reclaimed
these precious ashes to her heart, after they have slumbered
so many years unsepultured in a foreign land; that no
guilty consciousness of unworthy neglect may weigh upon her
spirit, and depress her proud front with shame; that no reproaching
echo of that eloquent voice that once so sweetly thrilled her,
pealing back upon her soul amidst her prideful recollections of the
past, may appal her in her feast of memory, and blast her revel of
glory; that no avenging muse, standing among the shrines of her
departed greatness, and searching in vain for that which should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
mark her remembrance of one she should so devoutly hallow,
shall have reason to sing of her as she has sung:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ungrateful Florence! Dante sleeps afar;<br /></span>
<span class="i05">And Scipio, buried by the upbraiding shore."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here, beneath the sunshine of the land he loved, and amid the
scenes which he consecrated with his genius, he will sleep well.
Sadly, yet proudly will his fond foster-mother receive within her
bosom to-day this cherished remnant of the child she nursed for
fame; doubly endeared to her, as he expired far away in a stranger
land, beyond the reach of her maternal embrace, and with no
kindred eyes to light the gathering darkness of death, no friendly
hand to soften his descent to the grave, no pious orisons to speed
his spirit on its long journey through eternity. Gently, reverently
let us lay him in this proud tabernacle, where he will dwell
embalmed in glory till the last trump shall reveal him to us all
radiant with the halo of his life. Let the Autumn's wind harp on
the dropping leaves her softest requiem over him; let the Winter's
purest snows rest spotless on his grave; let Spring entwine
her brightest garland for his tomb, and Summer gild it with her
mildest sunshine. Here let the marble minstrel rise to sing to the
future generations of the Commonwealth the inspiring lay of his
high genius and his lofty deeds. Here let the patriot repair when
doubts and dangers may encompass him, and he would learn the
path of duty and of safety&mdash;an oracle will inhabit these sacred
graves, whose responses will replenish him with wisdom, and point
him the way to virtuous renown. Let the ingenuous youth who
pants for the glories of the forum, and "the applause of listening
Senates," come hither to tune his soul by those immortal echoes
that will forever breathe about this spot and make its silence
vocal with eloquence. And here, too, let the soldier of liberty
come, when the insolent invader may profane the sanctuary of
freedom&mdash;here by this holy altar may he fitly devote to the infernal
gods the enemies of this country and of liberty.</p>

<p>We will now leave our departed patriot to his sleep of glory.
And let no tear moisten the turf that shall wrap his ashes. Let
no sound of mourning disturb the majestic solitude of his grand
repose. He claims no tribute of sorrow. His body returns to its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
mother earth, his spirit dwells in the Elysian domain of God, and
his deeds are written on the roll of Fame.</p>

<h2><a name="SARAH_T_BOLTON" id="SARAH_T_BOLTON">SARAH T. BOLTON</a></h2>


<p>Mrs. Sarah Tittle Bolton, author of <i>Paddle Your Own
Canoe</i>, was born at Newport, Kentucky, in 1820. When
she was about three years old, her father removed to Indiana,
settling first in Jennings county, but later moving
on to Madison. When a young woman, she contributed
poems to the Madison newspaper which attracted the editor,
Nathaniel Bolton, so strongly that he married the
author. They moved to Indianapolis, and Mrs. Bolton
soon gained a wide reputation as a poet. Her ode sung
at the laying of the corner-stone of the Masonic Temple,
in 1850, won her a loving cup from the Masons of Hoosierdom.
Two years later her poem in honor of the hero of
Hungary, Louis Kossuth, increased her fame. In 1855
Mr. Bolton was appointed consul to Geneva, Switzerland,
and his wife accompanied him to his post. They
remained in Switzerland for three years, during which
time Mrs. Bolton acted as correspondent for the Cincinnati
<i>Commercial</i>. In 1858 she and her husband returned
to Indianapolis, in which city he died some months
later. Her <i>Poems</i> (New York, 1856) brought her newspaper
and periodical verse together; and a complete collection,
with a notice of her life, was published at Indianapolis
in 1886. Mrs. Bolton was Indiana's foremost female
singer for many years. She died at Indianapolis
in 1893. Of her many poems <i>Paddle Your Own Canoe</i> is
the best known, although <i>Left on the Battlefield</i> is admired
by many of her readers.</p>

<h2><a name="JOHN_C_BRECKINRIDGE" id="JOHN_C_BRECKINRIDGE">JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE</a></h2>


<p>John Cabell Breckinridge, the youngest of the American
vice-presidents, distinguished as a public speaker,
was born near Lexington, Kentucky, January 21, 1821.
He was educated at Centre College, Danville, Kentucky,
and then studied law at Transylvania University. Breckinridge
lived at Burlington, Iowa, for a year, when he returned
to Lexington, Kentucky, to practice law. He
served in the Mexican War, and was afterwards a member
of Congress. In 1856, when he was about thirty-five
years of age, he was elected vice-president of the United
States, with James Buchanan as president. In 1860
Breckinridge was the candidate of the Southern slaveholders
for the presidency, but Abraham Lincoln received
180 electoral votes to his 72, Kentucky failing to support
him. He took his seat in the United States Senate in
March, 1861, as the successor of John J. Crittenden, and
he at once became the champion of the Southern Confederacy
in that body. He was expelled from the Senate on
December 4, 1861, on which occasion he delivered his farewell
address. Breckinridge then went South. He was appointed
a major-general, and he saw service at Shiloh,
Chickamauga, Cold Harbor, Nashville, and in several
other great battles. From January to April, 1865, General
Breckinridge was Jefferson Davis's secretary of war.
When the Confederacy surrendered, he made his escape
to Europe, where he remained for three years, when he
returned to Lexington and to his law practice. General
Breckinridge died at Lexington, Kentucky, May 17, 1875.
Ten years later an imposing statue was erected to his
memory on Cheapside, Lexington. He was a man of
most attractive personality, an eloquent orator, a capable
advocate, a brave soldier, an honest public servant, the
greatest member of the house of Breckinridge.</p>

<p class="center">HENRY CLAY</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>Obituary Addresses on the Occasion of the Death of the Hon. Henry
Clay</i> (Washington, 1852)]</p>

<p>Imperishably associated as his name has been for fifty years
with every great event affecting the fortunes of our country, it is
difficult to realize that he is indeed gone forever. It is difficult to
feel that we shall see no more his noble form within these walls&mdash;that
we shall hear no more his patriot tones, now rousing his countrymen
to vindicate their rights against a foreign foe, now imploring
them to preserve concord among themselves. We shall
see him no more. The memory and fruits of his services alone remain
to us. Amidst the general gloom, the Capitol itself looks
desolate, as if the genius of the place had departed. Already the
intelligence has reached almost every quarter of the Republic, and
a great people mourn with us to-day, the death of their most illustrious
citizen. Sympathizing as we do deeply with his family
and friends, yet private affliction is absorbed in the general sorrow.
The spectacle of a whole community lamenting the loss of
a great man, is far more touching than any manifestation of private
grief. In speaking of a loss which is national, I will not
attempt to describe the universal burst of grief with which Kentucky
will receive these tidings. The attempt would be vain to
depict the gloom that will cover her people, when they know that
the pillar of fire is removed, which has guided their footsteps for
the life of a generation.</p>

<p>The life of Mr. Clay, sir, is a striking example of the abiding
fame which surely awaits the direct and candid statesman. The
entire absence of equivocation or disguise, in all his acts, was his
master-key to the popular heart; for while the people will forgive
the errors of a bold and open nature, he sins past forgiveness who
deliberately deceives them. Hence Mr. Clay, though often defeated
in his measures of policy, always secured the respect of his
opponents without losing the confidence of his friends. He never
paltered in a double cause. The country was never in doubt as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
his opinions or his purposes. In all the contests of his time, his
position on great public questions was as clear as the sun in a
cloudless sky. Sir, standing by the grave of this great man, and
considering these things, how contemptible does appear the mere
legerdemain of politics! What a reproach is his life on that false
policy which would trifle with a great and upright people! If I
were to write his epitaph, I would inscribe, as the highest eulogy,
on the stone which shall mark his resting-place, "Here lies a man
who was in the public service for fifty years, and never attempted
to deceive his countrymen."</p>

<p>While the youth of America should imitate his noble qualities,
they may take courage from his career, and note the high proof it
affords that, under our equal institutions, the avenues of honour
are open to all. Mr. Clay rose by the force of his own genius, unaided
by power, patronage, or wealth. At an age when our young
men are usually advanced to the higher schools of learning, provided
only with the rudiments of an English education, he turned
his steps to the West, and amid the rude collisions of a border-life,
matured a character whose highest exhibitions were destined to
mark eras in his country's history. Beginning on the frontiers
of American civilization, the orphan boy, supported only by the
consciousness of his own powers, and by the confidence of the
people, surmounted all the barriers of adverse fortune, and won
a glorious name in the annals of his country. Let the generous
youth, fired with honorable ambition, remember that the American
system of government offers on every hand bounties to merit. If,
like Clay, orphanage, obscurity, poverty, shall oppress him; yet if,
like Clay, he feels the Promethean spark within, let him remember
that his country, like a generous mother, extends her arms to welcome
and to cherish every one of her children whose genius and
worth may promote her prosperity or increase her renown.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the signs of woe around us, and the general voice
announce that another great man has fallen. Our consolation is
that he was not taken in the vigour of his manhood, but sank into
the grave at the close of a long and illustrious career. The great
statesmen who have filled the largest space in the public eye, one
by one are passing away. Of the three great leaders of the Senate,
one alone remains, and he must follow soon. We shall witness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
no more their intellectual struggles in the American Forum; but
the monuments of their genius will be cherished as the common
property of the people, and their names will continue to confer
dignity and renown upon their country.</p>

<p>Not less illustrious than the greatest of these will be the name
of Clay&mdash;a name pronounced with pride by Americans in every
quarter of the globe; a name to be remembered while history shall
record the struggles of modern Greece for freedom, or the spirit
of liberty burn in the South American bosom; a living and immortal
name&mdash;a name that would descend to posterity without
the aid of letters, borne by tradition from generation to generation.
Every memorial of such a man will possess a meaning and
a value to his countrymen. His tomb will be a hallowed spot.
Great memories will cluster there, and his countrymen, as they
visit it, may well exclaim&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="JAMES_WEIR_Sr" id="JAMES_WEIR_Sr">JAMES WEIR, Sr.</a></h2>


<p>James Weir, Senior, an early Kentucky romancer, was
born at Greenville, Kentucky, June 16, 1821. He was the
son of James Weir, a Scotch-Irish merchant and quasi-author.
He was graduated from Centre College, Danville,
Kentucky, in 1840, and later studied law at Transylvania
University. He engaged in the practice of law at Owensboro,
Kentucky&mdash;first known as the Yellow Banks&mdash;and
on March 1, 1842, he was married to Susan C. Green,
daughter of Judge John C. Green of Danville. Weir
wrote a trilogy of novels which do not deserve the obscurity
into which they have fallen. They were called
<i>Lonz Powers, or the Regulators</i> (Philadelphia, 1850, two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
vols.); <i>Simon Kenton, or the Scout's Revenge</i> (Philadelphia,
1852); and <i>The Winter Lodge, or Vow Fulfilled</i>
(Philadelphia, 1854). All of these romances were thrown
upon historical backgrounds, and they created much favorable
criticism at the time of their publication. Weir
wrote numerous sketches and verses, but these were his
only published books. Business, bar sufficient to all literary
labors, pressed hard upon him, and he practically
abandoned literature. In 1869 he was elected president
of the Owensboro and Russellville railroad; and for nearly
forty years he was president of the Deposit bank at
Owensboro. Weir died at Owensboro, Kentucky, January
31, 1906. His son, Dr. James Weir, Junior, was an author
of considerable reputation.</p>

<p class="center">SIMON KENTON</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>Simon Kenton; or, The Scout's Revenge</i> (Philadelphia, 1852)]</p>

<p>By the side of the Sergeant [Duffe, in whose North Carolina
home the tale opens] sat a stout, powerfully framed, and wild-looking
being, whose visage, though none of the whitest (for it
was very unfashionably sunburnt), betokened an Anglo-Saxon;
whilst his dress and equipments went far to proclaim him a savage;
and, had it not been for his language (though none of the
purest), it would have been somewhat difficult to settle upon his
race! In a court of justice, especially in the South, where color
is considered <i>prima facie</i> evidence of slavery, we wouldn't have
given much for his chance of freedom. Simon Kenton, or Sharp-Eye,
for such were the titles given him by his parents, and by his
border companions, and he answered readily to them both, in his
dress and appearance, presented a striking picture of the daring
half savage characters everywhere to be found at that day (and,
indeed, at the present time) upon our extreme western frontier.
A contemporary of Boone, and one of the most skillful and determined
scouts of Kentucky, or the "Cane-Land," as it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
then sometimes called, Kenton's dress, composed of a flowing
hunting-shirt of tanned buckskin, with pants, or rather leggins,
of the same material&mdash;a broad belt, buckled tight around his
waist, supporting a tomahawk and hunting-knife&mdash;a gay pair of
worked moccasins, with a capacious shot-pouch swung around his
neck and ornamented with long tufts of black hair, resembling
very much, as in truth they were, the scalp-locks of the western
Indian, gave him a decidedly savage appearance, and declared at
once his very recent return from a dangerous life upon the frontier.
He had been a fellow-soldier of Duffe during the Revolution;
but, after the war, being of an adventurous and daring disposition,
had wandered out West, where he had already become
famous in the many bloody border frays between the savage and
early settler, and was considered second, in skill and cool bravery,
to no scout of the "Dark and Bloody Ground." On a visit to the
Old States, as they were called at that period to distinguish them
from the more recent settlements in the West, Kenton was sojourning,
for the time, with his old friend and companion in
arms, not without a hope that, by his glowing descriptions of the
flowing savannas beyond the Blue Ridge, and of the wild freedom
of a frontier life, he might induce the latter to bear him company
upon his return to Kentucky. Six feet two inches in his moccasins,
with a well-knit sinewy frame to match his great height,
and with a broad, full, and open face, tanned and swarthy, it is
true, yet pleasant and bright, with a quiet, good-humored smile
and lighted up by a deep-blue eye, and with heavy masses of auburn
hair, and whiskers sweeping carelessly around and about his
countenance, Kenton exhibited in his person, as he sat before the
fire of the Sergeant, a splendid specimen of the genuine borderer,
and no wonder the Indian brave trembled at the redoubted name
of Sharp-Eye, and instinctively shrank from a contest with so
formidable a foe. Although, now surrounded by friends, and in
the house of an old comrade, the scout, as was natural with him
from long custom, still held grasped in his ready hand the barrel
of his trusty rifle, from which he never parted, not even when he
slept, and, at the same time, kept his ears wide awake to all suspicious
sounds, as if yet in the land of the enemy, and momentarily
expecting the wild yell of his accustomed foe. Notwithstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
he was well skilled in every species of woodcraft, an adept at following
the trail of the wild beasts of the forest, and familiar with
all the cunning tricks of the wily savage; yet, strange as it may
appear, he was the most credulous of men, and as simple as a
child in what is generally termed the "ways of the world," or, in
other words, the tortuous windings of policy and hypocrisy, so
often met with under the garb of civilization. Indeed, it has been
said of him "that his confidence in man, and his credulity were
such that the same man might cheat him twenty times; and, if he
professed friendship, he might cheat him still!" At the feet of
the scout lay the inseparable companion of all his journeyings,
his dog; and Bang, for such was the name of this prime favorite,
was as rough a specimen of the canine species as his master's
countenance was of the face divine! But Bang was, nevertheless,
a very knowing dog, and, ever and anon, now as his master became
excited in his descriptions of western scenes and adventures,
he would raise his head and look intelligently at the narrator, and
so wisely did he wag his shaggy tail, that more than once the
warm-hearted hunter, breaking off suddenly in his narrative,
would pat his trusty comrade upon the head, and swear, with a
hearty emphasis, "that Bang knew all about it!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Mary E. Wilson Betts, the author of a single lyric
which has preserved her name, was born at Maysville,
Kentucky, in January, 1824. Miss Wilson was educated
in the schools of her native town, and, on July 10, 1854,
she was married to Morgan L. Betts, editor of the <i>Detroit
Times</i>. She died at Maysville two months later, or on
September 19, 1854, of congestion of the brain, believed
to have been caused by the great gunpowder explosion
near Maysville on August 13, 1854. Mrs. Betts's husband
died in the following October. While she wrote
many poems, her brief tribute to Col. William Logan Crittenden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
kinsman of John J. Crittenden, who was a member
of Lopez's filibustering expedition to Cuba, in 1850,
has preserved her name for the present generation. Colonel
Crittenden was captured by the Cubans, shot, and his
brains beaten out. Before the shots were fired he was requested
to kneel, but he made his now famous reply: "A
Kentuckian kneels to none except his God, and always dies
facing his enemy!" When, in her far-away Kentucky
home, Mrs. Betts learned of Crittenden's fate, she wrote
her tribute to the memory of the gallant son of Kentucky,
which was first printed in the <i>Maysville Flag</i>. The editor
introduced the little poem thus: "The lines which follow
are from one of Kentucky's most gifted daughters of
song. Upon gentler themes the tones of her lyre have oft
been heard to breathe their music. To sing to the warrior,
its cords have ne'er been strung till now; the tragic death,
and last eloquent words of the gallant Crittenden, have
caused this tribute to his memory." This poem has been
republished many times and in various forms. During
the Spanish-American war in 1898 it was often seen in
print as being typical of the courage of the soldiers of this
country.</p>

<h2><a name="REUBEN_T_DURRETT" id="REUBEN_T_DURRETT">REUBEN T. DURRETT</a></h2>


<p>Reuben Thomas Durrett, founder of the Filson Club and
editor of its publications, was born near Eminence, Kentucky,
January 22, 1824. He was graduated from Brown
University, Providence, Rhode Island, in 1849. The following
year he began the practice of law at Louisville,
and for the next thirty years he was one of the leaders of
the Louisville bar. He was editor of the <i>Louisville Courier</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
from 1857 to 1859, and throughout his long life he has
been a contributor of historical essays to the Louisville
press. Colonel Durrett was imprisoned for his Southern
sympathies during the Civil War, and for this reason he
saw little service. In 1871 he founded the Public Library
of Louisville; and in 1884 he organized the now well-known
Filson Club, which meets monthly in his magnificent
library&mdash;the greatest collection of Kentuckiana in
the world. While his library has never been catalogued,
he must possess at least thirty thousand books, pamphlets,
manuscripts, and newspaper files. Col. Theodore
Roosevelt, Dr. Robert M. McElroy, and many other
historical investigators have made important "finds" in
Colonel Durrett's library. He has one of the six extant
copies of the first edition of John Filson's <i>History of Kentucke</i>;
and he has the copy of Dean Swift's <i>Gulliver's
Travels</i>, which Neely, the pioneer, read to Daniel Boone on
Lulbegrub Creek, near Winchester, Kentucky, in 1770, as
they sat around the evening camp fire. The Filson club was
founded to increase the interest then taken in historical
subjects in Kentucky, and to issue an annual publication.
That this purpose has been well carried out may be seen
by the twenty-six handsome and valuable monographs
which have appeared.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The Club's first book was Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
Durrett's <i>The Life and Writings of John Filson, the first
historian of Kentucky</i> (Louisville, 1884). This work
brought Filson into world-wide notice and revived an interest
in his precious little history. <i>An Historical Sketch
of St. Paul's Church, Louisville</i> (Louisville, 1889); <i>The
Centenary of Kentucky</i> (Louisville, 1892); <i>The Centenary

1897); and <i>Traditions of the Earliest Visits of Foreigners
to North America</i> (Louisville, 1908), all of which
are Filson Club publications, comprise Colonel Durrett's

himself and of his books.</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>The Centenary of Louisville</i> (Louisville, Kentucky, 1893)]</p>

<p>In the year 1808, while digging the foundation of the great
flouring mill of the Tarascons in that part of Louisville known as
Shippingport, it became necessary to remove a large sycamore
tree, the trunk of which was six feet in diameter, and the roots of which penetrated the earth for forty feet around. Under the
center of the trunk of this tree was found an iron hatchet, which
was so guarded by the base and roots that no human hand could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
have placed it there after the tree grew. It must have occupied
the spot where it was found when the tree began to grow. The
hatchet was made by bending a flat bar of iron around a cylinder
until the two ends met, and then welding them together and hammering
them to a cutting edge, leaving a round hole at the bend
for a handle. The annulations of this tree were two hundred in
number, thus showing it to be two hundred years old according
to the then mode of computation. Here was a find which proved
to be a never-ending puzzle to the early scientists of the Falls of
the Ohio. The annulations of this tree made it two hundred
years old, and so fixed the date earlier than any white man or
user of iron was known to have been at the falls. One thought
that Moscoso, the successor of De Soto, in his wanderings up the
Mississippi and Missouri rivers, might have entered the Ohio and
left the hatchet there in 1542; another, that it might have come
from the Spaniards who settled St. Augustine in 1565; another,
that the Spaniards who went up the Ohio in 1669 in search of
silver might have left it where it was found; and another, that
Marquette, when he discovered the Upper Mississippi in 1673, or
La Salle, when he sailed down to its mouth in 1682, might have
given the hatchet to an Indian, who left it at the Falls. But
from these reasonable conjectures their learning and imagination
soon led these savants into the wildest theories and conjectures.
One thought that the Northmen, whom the Sagas of Sturleson
made discoverers of America in the eleventh century, had brought
the hatchet to this country; another, that Prince Madoc, who left
a principality in Wales in the twelfth century for a home in the
western wilderness, might have brought it here; and another, that
it might have been brought here by those ancient Europeans
whom Diodorus and Pausanius and other classical writers assure
us were in communication with this country in ancient times.
One of these learned ethnologists finally went so far as to advance
the theory of the Egyptian priests, as related by Plato, that the
autochthons of our race brought it here before the Island of Atlantis,
lying between Europe and America, went down in the
ocean and cut off all further communication between the continents.</p>

<p>This hatchet, however, really furnished no occasion for such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
strained conjectures and wild speculations. If the sycamore
under which it was found was two hundred years old, as indicated
by its annulations, it must have begun to grow about the time
that Jamestown in Virginia and Quebec in Canada were founded.
It would have been no unreasonable act for an Indian or white
man to have brought this hatchet from the English on the James,
or from the French on the St. Lawrence, to the Falls of the Ohio
in 1608, just two hundred years before it was discovered by removing
the tree that grew over it. The known habit of the sycamore,
however, to make more than one annulation in years particularly
favorable to growth suggests that two hundred annulations
do not necessarily mean that many years. If we allow
about fifty per cent of the life of the tree to have been during
years exceptionally favorable to its growth, and assign double
annulations to these favorable years, we shall have this tree to
have made its two hundred annulations in about one hundred and
thirty-nine years, and to have sprung from its seed and to have
begun its growth about the year 1669 or 1670, when La Salle, the
great French explorer, is believed to have been at the Falls of the
Ohio. We have no account of any one at the Falls in 1608, or
about this time, to support the conjecture that it might have come
from Jamestown or Quebec; but we have La Salle at this place in
1669 or 1670, and it is not unreasonable that he should have left it
here at that time. In this sense the old rusty hatchet, which is
fortunately preserved, becomes interesting to us all for its connection
with the discovery of Louisville. It is a souvenir of the
first white man who ever saw the Falls of the Ohio. It is a memento
of Robert Cavalier de La Salle, the discoverer of the site
of the city of Louisville.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="RICHARD_H_COLLINS" id="RICHARD_H_COLLINS">RICHARD H. COLLINS</a></h2>


<p>Richard Henry Collins, whom Mr. James Lane Allen has
happily christened "the Kentucky Froissart," was born
at Maysville, Kentucky, May 4, 1824, over the office of
<i>The Eagle</i>. He was the son of Lewis Collins (1797-1870),
who published a history of Kentucky in 1847. Richard
H. Collins was a Cincinnati lawyer for eleven years, but
he lived many years at Maysville, where he edited the old
<i>Eagle</i>, which his father had made famous. In 1861 he
founded the <i>Danville Review</i>; and in 1874 he published a
"revised, enlarged four-fold, and brought down to the
year 1874" edition, in two enormous volumes, of his
father's history of Kentucky. Unquestionably this is a
work of tremendous importance, the most magnificent and
elaborate history of this or any other State yet compiled.
Traveling the whole State over, obtaining contributions
from each town's ablest writer, and then building them
upon his father's fine foundation, Collins was able to publish
an almost invaluable work. To-day his history of
Kentucky, though it certainly contains many errors of
various kinds and degrees, is the greatest mine of our
State's history which all must explore if they would be informed
of our people's past. Dean Shaler and all later
Kentucky historical writers have taken pleasure in paying
tribute to his work. The one mistake that Collins
made, which might have been easily avoided, was to put
his manuscripts together in such a manner that the authorship
of the various papers cannot be determined; but
in this he followed his father's methods; and for this reason
the writer has been compelled to reproduce the prefaces
of both books, rather than portions of the actual
text, for fear he may use matter prepared by a contributor.
Collins practiced law in different Kentucky towns,
wrote for newspapers and magazines, and spent a very
busy and rather active life. He died at the home of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
daughter at Maryville, Missouri, on New Year's Day of

<p class="center">PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>History of Kentucky</i> (Covington, Kentucky, 1882, v. ii)]</p>

<p>Twenty-seven years, 1847 to 1874, have elapsed since <i>Collins's
History of Kentucky</i> quietly and modestly claimed recognition
among the standard local histories in the great American republic.
That has been an eventful period. Death, too, has been
busy with the names in the Preface above&mdash;has claimed alike the
author and compiler, Judge Lewis Collins, and about one hundred
and fifty more of the honored and substantial names who
contributed information or other aid towards preserving what
was then unwritten of the history of the State. The author of
the present edition (now nearly fifty years of age) is the youngest
of the forty-two contributors who are still living; while several
of them are over eighty and one is over ninety-two years of age.
Time has dealt gently with them; fame has followed some, and
fortune others; a few have achieved both fame and fortune, while
a smaller few lay claim to neither.</p>

<p>It is not often, as in this case, that the mantle of duty as a
state-historian falls from the father to the son's shoulders. It has
been faithfully and conscientiously worn; how well and ably, let
the disinterested and unprejudiced judge.</p>

<p>The present edition had its origin in this: When Judge Collins
died, the Legislature of Kentucky was in session. As its
testimonial and appreciation of his services and character, this
resolution was unanimously adopted, and on March 21, 1870, approved
by Gov. Stevenson:</p>

<p>"<i>Resolved by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of
Kentucky</i>:</p>

<p>"That we have heard with deep regret of the death of Judge
Lewis Collins, of Maysville, Kentucky, which has occurred since
the meeting of this General Assembly. He was a native Kentuckian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
of great purity of character and enlarged public spirit;
associated for half a century with the press of the State, which he
adorned with his patriotism, his elevated morals, and his enlightened
judgment. He was the author of a <i>History of Kentucky</i>,
evidencing extended research, and which embodies in a permanent
form the history of each county in the State, and the lives of its
distinguished citizens, and is an invaluable contribution to the
literature and historical knowledge of the State. His name being
thus perpetually identified with that of his native State, this
General Assembly, from a sense of duty and regard for his memory,
expresses this testimonial of its appreciation of his irreproachable
character and valued services."</p>

<p>This touching, and tender, and noble tribute to the departed
author and editor, was but the culmination of a sympathy broader
than the State, for it was echoed and sent back by many citizens
from a distance. He had lived to some purpose. It was no
small comfort to his family, to know that their bereavement was
regarded as a public bereavement; and that his name and works
would live on, and be green in the memory of the good people of
Kentucky&mdash;the place of his birth, the home of his manhood, the
scene of his life's labors, his grave. In a spontaneous tribute of
praise and sympathy, the entire newspaper press of the State, and
many in other States, announced his decease.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That action of the State, and those generous outpourings of
sympathy and regard, started fresh inquiries for the work that
had made him best known&mdash;<i>Collins's History of Kentucky</i>. It
had been <i>out of print</i> for more than twenty years! It was known
that I had been associated with my father as an editor, and then
his successor, and had assisted him with his <i>History</i>. Hence,
many applications and inquiries for the book were made to me;
always with the suggestion that I ought to prepare a new edition,
enlarged, and bring down to the present the history of the State.
It was an important undertaking&mdash;as delicate as important. I
shrank from the great responsibility, and declined. But the
urgency continued, for the necessity of a State history was felt.
The great State of Kentucky, the mother of statesmen and heroes,
the advance guard of civilization west of the great Appalachian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
chain, had no published <i>History</i> of the last twenty-six years; and
no <i>History</i> at all in book form, <i>now accessible</i> to more than a few
thousand of the intelligent minds among her million-and-a-third
of inhabitants. The duty of preparing this <i>History</i> sought <i>me</i>,
and not I <i>it</i>. It has been a task of tremendous labor, extending
through the long weary months of nearly four years. But it has
been a sweet and a proud task, and the <i>destiny</i> that seemed driving
me on is almost fulfilled. I wish I could know the verdict
of the future upon my labors, but that is impossible. The carping
and noisy fault-finding of the dissatisfied and ungenerous few
are far from being pleasant; but the consciousness of duty done,
with an honest heart, and the praise of the liberal ones who will
appreciate the work, will be a noble and a proud satisfaction, and
a joy ceasing only with my life.</p>

<h2><a name="ANNIE_C_KETCHUM" id="ANNIE_C_KETCHUM">ANNIE C. KETCHUM</a></h2>


<p>Mrs. Annie Chambers Ketchum, poet, naturalist, and
novelist, was born near Georgetown, Kentucky, November
8, 1824, the daughter of Benjamin Stuart Chambers,
founder of Cardome Academy; her mother was a member
of the famous Bradford family of journalists. Miss
Chambers was graduated from Georgetown Female College
with the M. A. degree. Her first husband was William
Bradford, whom she married in 1844, and from
whom she was subsequently divorced. After her separation
from her husband, she went to Memphis, Tennessee,
and opened a school for girls, which she conducted for
several years. In 1858 she was married to Leonidas
Ketchum, a Tennessean, who was mortally wounded at the
battle of Shiloh in 1863. After her husband's death,
Mrs. Ketchum returned to Kentucky and conducted a
school at Georgetown for three years, but, in 1866, she returned
to Memphis, where she again taught for a number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
of years. Mrs. Ketchum spent the winter of 1875 at
Paris, France, pursuing her literary work, and on May 24,
1876, she entered upon the novitiate in a convent there.
She afterwards returned to America and her last years
were spent in Kentucky. Mrs. Ketchum died in 1904.
Her first literary work to attract attention was a novel,
entitled <i>Nellie Bracken</i> (Philadelphia, 1855). From
1859 to 1861 Mrs. Ketchum was editor of <i>The Lotus</i>, a
monthly magazine published at Memphis. <i>Benny: A
Christmas Ballad</i> (New York, 1869) was the first of her
poems to attract any considerable attention; and her best
known poem, <i>Semper Fidelis</i>, originally published in
<i>Harper's Magazine</i> for October, 1873, is a long, leisurely
thing that makes one wonder at its once wide popularity.
All of her poems Mrs. Ketchum brought together in <i>Lotus
Flowers</i> (New York, 1878). <i>Lotus</i> was her shibboleth,
and she never missed an opportunity to make use of
it. She made many translations from Latin, German,
and French writers, her finest work in this field being
<i>Marcella, a Russian Idyl</i> (New York, 1878). <i>The Teacher's
Empire</i> (1886) was a collection of educational essays
contributed to various journals. Mrs. Ketchum's <i>Botany
for Academies and Colleges</i> (Philadelphia, 1887),
was a text-book in many institutions for several years
subsequent to its publication.</p>

<h2><a name="FRANCIS_H_UNDERWOOD" id="FRANCIS_H_UNDERWOOD">FRANCIS H. UNDERWOOD</a></h2>


<p>Francis Henry Underwood, "the editor who was never
the editor" of <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>, though he was indeed
the projector and first associate editor of that famous
magazine, was born at Enfield, Massachusetts, January
12, 1825, the son of Roswell Underwood. He spent
the year of 1843-1844 at Amherst College, and in the summer
of 1844 he came out to Kentucky and settled at Bowling
Green as a school teacher. Underwood read law at
Bowling Green and was admitted to the bar of that town
in 1847. On May 18, 1848, he was married to Louisa
Maria Wood, of Taylorsville, Kentucky, to whom he afterwards
dedicated his Kentucky novel. While in Kentucky
Underwood wrote verses which he submitted to N. P.
Willis, who was then at Washington. The celebrated
critic wrote him: "Your poetry is as good as Byron's
was at the same stage of progress&mdash;correct, and evidently
inspired, and capable of expansion into stuff for
fame." None of it, however, has come down to us. Underwood's
intense hatred of slavery caused him to quit
Kentucky, in 1850, after having lived for six years in this
State, and to return to Massachusetts, where he was admitted
to the bar of Northampton. He enlisted in the
Free-soil movement with heart and soul. In 1852 he was
clerk of the Massachusetts Senate, which position he left
to become literary adviser for the then leading publishers
of New England, Phillips, Sampson and Company. In
1853 Underwood conceived the idea of a Free-soil literary
magazine, but a publisher's failure delayed its appearance.
In November, 1857, however, the first issue of <i>The
Atlantic Monthly</i> appeared, Dr. Holmes having christened
the "baby," with James Russell Lowell as editor-in-chief,
and Underwood as assistant editor. Lowell and
Underwood were great friends and they worked together
with pleasure and harmony. For two years they were
the editors, when the breaking up of the firm of Phillips,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
Sampson and Company, and the passing of the periodical
into the hands of Ticknor and Fields, caused Underwood
to resign. From 1859 to 1870 he was clerk of the Superior
Criminal Court of Boston; and from 1861 to 1875 he was
a member of the Boston School Committee. Underwood's
first three works were a <i>Handbook of English Literature</i>
(Boston, 1871); <i>Handbook of American Literature</i> (Boston,
1872); and <i>Cloud Pictures</i> (Boston, 1872), a group of
musical stories. Then came his Kentucky novel, entitled
<i>Lord of Himself</i> (Boston, 1874), which was really a series
of pictures of life at Bowling Green in 1844. This tale
was well received by the Kentucky press and public, the
background and characters were declared realistic, and
the author's effort to make something pathetic out of the
old system of slavery was smiled at and dismissed in the
general pleasure his story gave. In his imaginary Kentucky
county of Barry, Underwood had a merry time rehabilitating
the past. The character of Arthur Howard
is the author himself. <i>Lord of Himself</i> is a work of high
merit, and it does not deserve the oblivion into which it
has fallen. In 1880 Underwood's second novel, <i>Man Proposes</i>,
was published, together with his <i>The True Story of
Exodus</i>. Two years later his biographies of Longfellow
and Lowell were issued; and in 1883 his study of Whittier
was published. In 1885 President Cleveland named
Underwood United States Consul at Glasgow; and three
years later the University of Glasgow granted him LL.D.
During Cleveland's second administration Underwood
was consul at Edinburgh. While in Scotland he wrote his
last two novels, called <i>Quabbin</i> (Boston, 1892), and <i>Dr.
Gray's Quest</i>. In <i>Quabbin</i> he described his native town
of Enfield in much the same manner that he had years before
written of Bowling Green, Kentucky. Underwood
died at Edinburgh, August 8, 1894.</p>

time.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">ALOYSIUS AND MR. FENTON</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>Lord of Himself</i> (Boston, 1874)]</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that the youth of many locks and ample
Byronic shirt collar appeared on the scene. Aloysius Pittsinger
was his name. He was a consolation. His very name, Aloysius,
had a sweet gurgle in the sound, resembling the anticipatory and
involuntary noises from children's mouths at the sight of sugar
lollipops. He was a clerk in Mr. Goldstein's store. There he
dispensed tobacco, both fine-cut and plug, assorted nails, New
Orleans sugar, Rio coffee, Porto Rico molasses, Gloucester mackerel,
together with foreign cloths and homespun jeans, and all
the gimcracks which little negroes coveted and the swarms of
summer flies had spared.</p>

<p>The appearance of Aloysius happened in this wise. Mr. Fenton
was an early riser, but was loath to go to his shop without his
breakfast. On the fateful morning he had come down rather
earlier than usual. After due search and discussion, it was announced
to him that there was nothing at once appetizing and
substantial in the house that could, within the desired period, be
got ready for the table; and his wife made bold to ask if in this
emergency he wouldn't go out and get something. To a hungry
man, in the faint interval after a "nipper" and before a solid
bit, such a proposition is an unpleasant surprise. But, after devoting
the cook and the household generally to immediate pains
and inconveniences, and to something more hereafter, Mr. Fenton
put on his slouched hat and started out. He mused also.</p>

<p>If I were ambitious of the fame of the great American novelist,
or were contending for the fifty thousand dollar prize offered by
the publishers of the Metropolitan Album, and hoped to have my
thrilling descriptions read by its subscribing army of three hundred
and fifty-one thousand chambermaids, I might paint the
current of his swift thought thus:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>"The air bites shrewdly. Ha, by the mass! Shall I to the
<i>abattoir</i> and ask the slayer of oxen for a steak? or a chop from
the loin of sheep, a bell-wether of Kentucky's finest flock&mdash;Kentucky,
state renowned for dainty mutton? Or does the slayer of
oxen yet sleep, supinely stertorous, heavy with the lingering
fumes of the mighty Bourbon? Perchance he has no steak, no
chop!&mdash;all gone to feed an insatiable people! Bethink me. Ay&mdash;and
the <i>abattoir</i> is far, though its perfume is nigh; it is thrice
a hundred yards from hence. I will go to the house of the Israelite,
Goldstein, and get a fish&mdash;a fish dear to losel Yankees, and
not scorned by the sons of the sun-land either. 'Tis well. I will
make the trial. Haply I shall find that the young man, Pittsinger,
whose prnomen is Aloysius, has arisen, and is even now
combing his ambrosial locks."</p>

<p>What he <i>did</i> think was something like this:</p>

<p>"It's doggon cold this mornin'. I wonder whether that derned
old drunken Bill Stone's got ary bit of fresh meat&mdash;and if he's
up yet. I don't b'lieve it, for he was drunk's an owl last night at
old Red Eye. Besides, it's fer to the slaughter-house. Le's see.
I might get a mackerel at Goldstein's. I'll do it. B'iled a little,
to take the salt out, and then het with cream, it ain't bad, by a
derned sight."</p>

<p>He walked out to the square, occasionally blowing his cold fingers.
The shutters were not taken down from Goldstein's front
windows, but Mr. Fenton knew that the clerk slept in a little room
in a ruinous lean-to back of the store, and he rattled the door to
call him. There was no answer, nor sound of any one stirring,
and he rattled again. His powerful shake made the square resound.
He called, endeavoring to throw his voice through the
key-hole, "Aloysius, ain't you up yit? I want a mackerel."</p>

<p>The silence was aggravating, and there were internal qualms
that made Fenton doubly impatient.</p>

<p>"Aloysius, you lazy bones! Do you hear? I want a mackerel
for breakfast. You're thest the no-countest boy I ever see! If
'twan't for your father, you'd thest starve."</p>

<p>Fenton sadly meditated, and was about to give it up, when he
heard a voice within, saying, "Never too late, Mr. Fenton. You
shall have your mackerel. You needn't wait. As soon as I get
my clothes on I'll tote you over one."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">AN AMAZING PROPHECY</p>

<p class="center">[From the same]</p>

<p>"The hardest strain upon the republic is yet to come," said
Mr. Pierrepont. "God only knows how the slavery question is to
be settled; but no change in policy will be adopted without a
severe struggle. If the South is worsted, it will have the terrible
problem of the status of the negroes to solve, and it will be a tumultuous
time for a generation. The danger to the North in the
event of success, or of defeat either, will arise from its wealth.
The accumulations at the commercial centres are to make them
enormously rich. Money is a power, and never a quiescent one.
Your rich men will put themselves into office, or they will send
their paid attorneys to legislate for them. They will so touch
the subtle springs of finance as to make every affair of state serve
their personal advantage. They will make corruption honorable,
and bribery a fine art. It is now a mark of decency and a badge
of distinction for a public man to be poor. Everyone knows that
a public man can't be rich honestly; but you will live to see congressmen
going to the capital carrying travelling-bags, and returning
home with wagon loads of trunks, and with stocks and
bonds that will enable them to snap their fingers at constituents."</p>

<p>"It is the old story of republics," said Mr. Howard. "They
are founded by valor, reared by industry, with frugality and
equal laws. Wealth follows, then corruption, then the public
conscience is debauched, faith is lost, and justice thrust out. Then
the general rottenness is shaken by the coming of a new Csar,
and an empire is welcomed because liberty had already been lost,
and anything is better than anarchy. However, let us hope this
is far away."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="STEPHEN_C_FOSTER" id="STEPHEN_C_FOSTER">STEPHEN C. FOSTER</a></h2>


<p>Stephen Collins Foster, the celebrated song writer, was
born at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, July 4, 1826. At the
age of fifteen years he entered Jefferson College, at Cannonsburg,
Pennsylvania, but music had set its seal upon
him and he soon returned to Pittsburgh to pursue it. The
next few years were almost entirely devoted to his musical
studies, though he had a living to make. The year of 1842
found Foster clerking in a Cincinnati store; and during
this time his first song, <i>Open Thy Lattice, Love</i>, was published
at Baltimore. <i>Uncle Ned</i>, and <i>O Susannah!</i> followed
fast upon his first effort, and the three launched
him upon his career. He relinquished his business cares,
and surrendered his life to song. In 1850 Foster married
Jane McDowell of Pittsburgh, and they lived at New York
City for a short time before settling at Pittsburgh. His
<i>Camptown Races</i>, and <i>My Old Kentucky Home, Goodnight</i>,
appeared in 1850. It is surely a regrettable fact
that the most famous Kentucky song was not written by a
Kentucky hand. Foster's only child, Mrs. Marion Foster
Welsh, of Pittsburgh, has recently repudiated the ancient
tale that is told of the origin of <i>My Old Kentucky Home</i>,
but as she declined to furnish the real history of the song,
saying she would make it known at the proper time,
nothing better than the often repeated story can be told
here. Foster was visiting his kinsman, Judge John
Rowan, at his home, "Federal Hill," near Bardstown,
Kentucky, and on this typical Southern plantation, with
its negroes and their cabins, <i>My Old Kentucky Home</i> was
written. The story is usually elaborated, but as it has
been set aside by the author's daughter, further comment
is not worth while. It is enough to know that it was written
in Kentucky. Foster went to New York City in 1860,
and the same year <i>Old Black Joe</i> appeared. <i>Old Folks at
Home</i>, <i>Nelly was a Lady</i>, <i>Nelly Bly</i>, <i>Massa's in the Cold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
Cold Ground</i>, <i>Old Dog Tray</i>, <i>Don't Bet Your Money on
the Shanghai</i>, <i>We Are Coming, Father Abraham</i>, and
dozens of other songs have kept Foster's fame green. His
beautiful serenade, <i>Come Where My Love Lies Dreaming</i>,
is his highest note in genuine scientific music. Foster
died at New York, January 13, 1864, and he was buried in
Allegheny cemetery, Pittsburgh. In 1906 the Kentucky
home-comers never seemed to tire of <i>My Old Kentucky
Home</i>, and a fitting memorial was unveiled at Louisville
by Foster's daughter in honor of the song's maker. It is
known and sung in the remotest corners of the world. Mr.
James Lane Allen's fine tribute to the poet's memory may
be found in <i>The Bride of the Mistletoe</i>:</p>

<p>"More than half a century ago the one starved genius of the
Shield [Kentucky], a writer of songs, looked out upon the summer
picture of this land, its meadows and ripening corn tops; and as
one presses out the spirit of an entire vineyard when he bursts a
solitary grape upon his tongue, he, the song writer, drained drop
by drop the wine of that scene into the notes of a single melody.
The nation now knows his song, the world knows it&mdash;the only
music that has ever captured the joy and peace of American home
life&mdash;embodying the very soul of it in the clear amber of sound."</p>

<p>Zachariah Frederick Smith, the Kentucky historian, was
born near Eminence, Kentucky, January 7, 1827. He
was educated at Bacon College, Harrodsburg, Kentucky.
During the Civil War he was president of Henry College
at New Castle, Kentucky. From 1867 to 1871 he
was superintendent of public instruction in Kentucky.
Professor Smith was subsequently interested in various
enterprises, and for four years he was connected with
the publishing firm of D. Appleton and Company. For
more than fifty years he was a curator of Transylvania
University. His <i>History of Kentucky</i> (Louisville, 1885;
1892), is the only exhaustive and readable history of the
Commonwealth from the beginnings down to the date of
its publication. In a sense it is the chronicles of the Collinses
transformed from the encyclopedic to the continuous
narrative form. Professor Smith's other works are:
<i>A School History of Kentucky</i> (Louisville, 1889); <i>Youth's
History of Kentucky</i> (Louisville, 1898); <i>The Mother of
Henry Clay</i> (Louisville, 1899); and <i>The Battle of New
Orleans</i> (Louisville, 1904). He spent the final years of
his life upon <i>The History of the Reformation of the 19th
Century, Inaugurated, Advocated, and Directed by Barton
W. Stone, of Kentucky: 1800-1832</i>, which was almost
ready for publication when he died. In this work Professor
Smith set forth that Barton W. Stone, and not
Alexander Campbell, was the founder of the Christian
("Campbellite") so-called "reformation" in this State,
and that its adherents are "Stoneites," not "Campbellites,"
as they are called by the profane. Professor
Smith died at Louisville, Kentucky, July 4, 1911, but he
was buried at Eminence.</p>

<p class="center">EARLY KENTUCKY DOCTORS</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>The History of Kentucky</i> (Louisville, 1892)]</p>

<p>It is probable Dr. Thomas Walker, of Virginia, was the first
physician who ever visited Kentucky. In 1745 he came and
negotiated treaties with the Indian tribes for the establishment of
a colony, which was announced in Washington's journal (1754)
as Walker's settlement on the Cumberland, accompanied by a
map, dated 1750. Some time just before 1770, Dr. John Connolly,
of Pittsburgh, visited the Falls of the Ohio, and three years
later, in company with Captain Thomas Bullitt, patented the land
on which Louisville now stands. But little is known of the professional
performances of either Walker or Connolly, except the
fact that they were both men of superior intelligence, and of far
more than average cultivation. They were both known as enterprising
business men rather than great practitioners of medicine.
In a <i>History of the Medical Literature of Kentucky</i>, Dr. Lunsford
P. Yandell (the elder) says: "The first surgical operation
ever performed in Kentucky by a white man occurred in 1767."
Colonel James Smith, in that year, accompanied by his black
servant, Jamie, traveled from the mouth of the Tennessee river
across the country to Carolina, now Tennessee. On their way,
Colonel Smith stepped upon a projecting fragment of cane, which
pierced his foot, and was broken off level with the skin. Swelling
quickly came on, causing the flesh to rise above the end of the
cane. Having no other instruments than a knife, a moccasin
awl, and a pair of bullet-molds, the colonel directed his servant
to seize the piece of cane with the bullet-molds, while he raised
the skin with the awl and cut the flesh away from around the piece
of cane, and, with the assistance of Jamie, the foreign body was
drawn out. Colonel Smith then treated the wound with the
bruised bark from the root of a lind tree, and subsequently by
poultices made of the same material, using the mosses of the
old logs in the forest, which he secured with strips of elm bark,
as a dressing.</p>

<p>Dr. Frederick Ridgely, a favorite pupil of Dr. Rush, was sent
from Philadelphia early in 1779, as a surgeon to a vessel sailing
with letters of marque and reprisal off the coast of Virginia. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
vessel was chased into the Chesapeake Bay by a British man-of-war.
As the ship's colors were struck to the enemy, Dr. Ridgely
leaped overboard, and narrowly escaped capture by swimming
two miles to the shore. He was at once thereafter appointed an
officer in the medical department of the Colonial army. A few
months later, he resigned his commission, and settled, in 1790, at
Lexington, where he speedily attained a leading position as a
master of the healing art. From Lexington he was frequently
called, in the capacity of surgeon, to accompany militia in their
expeditions against the Indians. He was appointed surgeon-general
to the army of "Mad Anthony Wayne," returning finally
to Lexington, where he took part in the organization of the first
medical college established in the West. Dr. Ridgely was a frequent
contributor to the <i>American Medical Repertory</i>, published
at Philadelphia. He was the intimate friend of Dr. Samuel
Brown, also of Lexington. At the organization of the medical
department of Transylvania University, in 1799, Brown and
Ridgely were the first professors. Ridgely, in that year, delivered
a course of lectures to a small class, and, as the organization of
the faculty had not been completed, no further attempts at teaching
were made. Dr. Samuel Brown, like his colleague, Ridgely,
was a surgeon of great ability and large experience. These two
gentlemen added greatly to the growth and popularity of Lexington
by their renown as surgeons. They attracted patients
from the remote settlements on the frontier, and were both frequent
contributors to the medical literature of that time. The
cases reported by these gentlemen were numerous, interesting,
carefully observed, and ably reported. Dr. Brown was a student
at the University of Edinburgh with Hosack, Davidge, Ephraim
McDowell, and Brockenborough, of Virginia. Hosack became
famous as a professor in the College of Physicians and Surgeons,
at New York; Davidge laid the foundation of the University of
Maryland; Brown was one of the first professors in Transylvania
University, at Lexington, while McDowell achieved immortal
fame in surgery as the father of ovariotomy. Strong rivalry in
the practice of medicine at Lexington, between Brown and
Ridgely, and Fishback and Pindell, had much to do with the difficulties
attending the efforts of the two former to establish the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
medical school. In 1798, Jenner made public his great discovery
of the protective power of vaccination. Dr. Brown, of Lexington,
was his first imitator on this continent. Within three years
from the date of Jenner's first publication, and before the experiment
had been tried elsewhere in this country, Brown had already
vaccinated successfully more than five hundred people at Lexington.</p>

<h2><a name="JOHN_A_BROADUS" id="JOHN_A_BROADUS">JOHN A. BROADUS</a></h2>


<p>John Albert Broadus, the most distinguished clergyman
and writer Kentucky Baptists have produced, was born
near Culpepper, Virginia, January 24, 1827. At the
age of sixteen years Broadus united with the Baptist
church; and he shortly afterwards decided to study for
the ministry of his church. He taught school for a time
before going to the University of Virginia, in 1846, and he
was graduated four years later with the M.A. degree.
While at the University Broadus was greatly impressed
by Professors Gessner Harrison, Wm. H. McGuffey, and
E. H. Courtenay. In 1851 Broadus declined a professorship
in Georgetown College, Georgetown, Kentucky, in
order to become assistant instructor of ancient languages
in his <i>alma mater</i> and pastor of the Charlottesville Baptist
church. In 1857 it was decided to establish the Southern
Baptist Theological Seminary at Greenville, South
Carolina, and Broadus, James P. Boyce, Basil Manly, Jr.,
William Williams, and E. T. Winkler, were the committee
on establishment. Boyce and Manly urged the curriculum
system, but Broadus advocated the elective system so
earnestly that he completely won them over. "So, as Mr.
Jefferson had drawn a new American university, Mr.
Broadus drew a new American seminary." The Seminary
opened in 1859 with the members of the committee,
with the exception of Williams, as the professors. Boyce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
was elected president, and Broadus occupied the chair of
New Testament Interpretation and Homiletics. Twenty-six
students greeted the faculty; and all were soon hard
at work. After a few years, however, the Civil War came
and the Seminary shortly suspended. During the war
Dr. Broadus was a chaplain in the Confederate armies.
At the close of the war work in the Seminary was resumed
with seven students enrolled, Dr. Broadus having
but one student in homiletics, and he was blind! The lectures
he prepared for this blind brother were the basis of
the work that made him famous, <i>The Preparation and Delivery
of Sermons</i> (Philadelphia, 1870), which is at the
present time the finest thing on the subject, a text-book in
nearly every theological school in Christendom. Dr.
Broadus declined chairs in Chicago and Brown universities,
and the presidency of Vassar College, in order to
remain with the Seminary, the darling of his dreams. In
1873 he read his notable paper in memory of Gessner Harrison
at the University of Virginia; and the next year he
joined Dr. Boyce in Kentucky in the effort that was then
being made to remove the Seminary to Louisville. His
lectures before the Newton Theological Seminary were
published as <i>The History of Preaching</i> (New York, 1876).
In 1877 the Seminary was removed to Louisville, Dr.
Boyce remaining as president and Dr. Broadus as professor
of homiletics. From the first the Seminary was a
success, it now being the largest in the United States.
In 1879 Dr. Broadus delivered his noted address upon
Demosthenes before Richmond College, Virginia, which
is regarded as one of the very finest efforts of his
life. In Louisville he became the city's first citizen, honored
and beloved by all classes. In 1886 Harvard conferred
the degree of Doctor of Divinity upon him; and
later in the same year one of the most important of his
books appeared, <i>Sermons and Addresses</i> (Baltimore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
1886). This was followed by his famous <i>Commentary on
Matthew</i> (Philadelphia, 1887), which was begun during
the darkest days of the Civil War, and is now considered
the best commentary in English on that Gospel. Dr. Boyce
died at Pau, France, in 1888, and Dr. Broadus succeeded
him as president of the Seminary. In January, 1889, he
delivered the Lyman Beecher lectures on <i>Preaching</i> at
Yale; and some months later his <i>Translation of and Notes
to Chrysostom's Homilies</i> (New York, 1889) appeared.
In the spring of 1890 Dr. Broadus delivered three lectures
before Johns Hopkins University, which were published
as <i>Jesus of Nazareth</i> (New York, 1890). He spent the
summer of 1892 in Louisville preparing his <i>Memoir of
James P. Boyce</i> (New York, 1893); and <i>A Harmony of
the Gospels</i> (New York, 1893), his final works. Dr.
Broadus died at Louisville, Kentucky, March 16, 1895.</p>

<p>We had four and a half hours at Oxford, and spent it with exceeding
great pleasure, and most respectably heavy expense.</p>

<p>At University College we saw a memorial of Sir Wm. Jones,
by Flaxman, which I am sure I shall never forget&mdash;worthy of
Sir Wm. and worthy of Flaxman. At Magdalen College we
saw the varied and beautiful grounds, with the Poet's Walk,
where Addison loved to stroll. At New College we visited the
famous and beautiful chapel. (New College is now five hundred
years old.) These are the most remarkable of the nineteen colleges.
You know they are entirely distinct establishments, as
much as if a hundred miles apart, and that the University of Oxford
is simply a general organization which gives degrees to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
men prepared by the different colleges. Then we spent one and
a half hours at the famous Bodleian Library, the most valuable
(British Museum has the largest number of books) in the world.
Oh, the books, the books&mdash;the early and rare editions, the illuminated
manuscripts of the Middle Ages, the autographs of
famous persons, and the portraits, the portraits of hundreds of
the earth's greatest ones. Happy students, fellows, professors,
who have constant access to the Bodleian Library.</p>


<p class="center">SPURGEON</p>

<p class="center">[From the same]</p>

<p>I was greatly delighted with Spurgeon, especially with his conduct
of public worship. The congregational singing has often
been described, and is as good as can well be conceived. Spurgeon
is an excellent reader of Scripture, and remarkably impressive
in reading hymns, and the prayers were quite what they
ought to have been. The sermon was hardly up to his average in
freshness, but was exceedingly well delivered, without affectation
or apparent effort, but with singular earnestness, and directness.
The whole thing&mdash;house, congregation, order, worship, preaching,
was as nearly up to my ideal as I ever expect to see in this
life. Of course Spurgeon has his faults and deficiencies, but he
is a wonderful man. Then he preaches the real gospel, and God
blesses him. After the services concluded, I went to a room in the
rear to present my letter, and was cordially received. Somebody
must tell Mrs. V&mdash;&mdash; that I "thought of her" repeatedly during
the sermon, and "gave her love" to Spurgeon, and he said such
a message encouraged him. (I made quite a little story of it, and
the gentlemen in the room were apparently much interested, not
to say amused.)</p>

<p>We went straight towards St. Paul's, where Liddon has been
preaching every Sunday afternoon in September, and there would
be difficulty in getting a good seat. We lunched at the Cathedral
Hotel, hard by, and then stood three-quarters of an hour at the
door of St. Paul's, waiting for it to open. Meantime a good
crowd had collected behind us, and there was a tremendous rush
when the door opened, to get chairs near the preaching stand.
The crowd looked immense in the vast cathedral, and yet there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
were not half as many as were quietly seated in Spurgeon's Tabernacle. There everybody could hear, and here, in the grand and
beautiful show-place, Mr. Liddon was tearing his throat in the
vain attempt to be heard by all. The grand choral service was
all Chinese to me.</p>

<h2><a name="MARY_J_HOLMES" id="MARY_J_HOLMES">MARY J. HOLMES</a></h2>


<p>Mrs. Mary Jane Holmes, a family favorite for fifty years,
was born at Brookfield, Massachusetts, April 5, 1828. She
became a teacher at an early age, and at Allen's Hill, New
York, on August 9, 1849, she was married to Daniel
Holmes, a Yale man of the class of 1848, who had been
teaching the year between his graduation and marriage at
Versailles, Kentucky. Immediately after the ceremony
he and his bride started to Kentucky, where Mrs. Holmes
joined her husband in teaching. In 1850 they gave up the
school at Versailles, taking charge of the district school
at Glen's Creek, near Versailles. Here they taught for
two years, when Mr. Holmes decided to relinquish teaching
for the practice of law, and they removed to Brockport,
New York, their home henceforth. Mrs. Holmes
returned to Kentucky in 1857, for a visit, and this, with
the three years indicated above, included her Kentucky
life. Having settled at Brockport, she began her career as
a novelist. Her first and best known book, <i>Tempest and
Sunshine, or Life in Kentucky</i>, was published in 1854. Mr.
Middleton, one of the chief characters in this novel, was a
rather close characterization of a Kentucky planter, Mr.
Singleton, who resided some miles from Versailles; and
his daughter, Sue Singleton, subsequently Mrs. Porter, always
claimed, though facetiously, that she was the original
of <i>Tempest</i>. It is now known, however, that Mrs.
Holmes had not thought of her in delineating the character,
and that the Singleton home is the only thing in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
book that is drawn from actual life with any detail whatever.
In her Kentucky books that followed <i>Tempest and
Sunshine</i>, she usually built an accurate background for
characters that lived only in her imagination. Besides <i>Tempest
and Sunshine</i>, Mrs. Holmes was the author of thirty-four
books, published in the order given: <i>The English
Orphans</i>; <i>Homestead on the Hillside</i>, a book of Kentucky
stories; <i>Lena Rivers</i>, a Kentucky novel, superior to <i>Tempest
and Sunshine</i>; <i>Meadow Brook</i>; <i>Dora Deane</i>; <i>Cousin
Maude</i>; <i>Marian Grey</i>, a Kentucky story; <i>Darkness and
Daylight</i>; <i>Hugh Worthington</i>, another Kentucky novel;
<i>The Cameron Pride</i>; <i>Rose Mather</i>; <i>Ethelyn's Mistake</i>;
<i>Millbank</i>; <i>Edna Browning</i>; <i>West Lawn</i>; <i>Edith Lyle</i>; <i>Mildred</i>;
<i>Daisy Thornton</i>; <i>Forrest House</i>; <i>Chateau D'Or</i>;
<i>Madeline</i>; <i>Queenie Hetherton</i>; <i>Christmas Stories</i>; <i>Bessie's
Fortune</i>; <i>Gretchen</i>; <i>Marguerite</i>; <i>Dr. Hathern's Daughters</i>;
<i>Mrs. Hallam's Companion</i>; <i>Paul Ralston</i>; <i>The Tracy
Diamonds</i>; <i>The Cromptons</i>; <i>The Merivale Banks</i>; <i>Rena's
Experiment</i>; and <i>The Abandoned Farm</i>. About two million
copies of Mrs. Holmes's books have been sold by her
authorized publishers; how many have been sold in pirated
editions cannot, of course, be ascertained. Mrs.
Holmes died at Brockport, New York, October 6, 1907.</p>

<p class="center">THE SCHOOLMASTER</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>Lena Rivers</i> (New York, 1856)]</p>

<p>And now Mr. Everett was daily expected. Anna, who had no
fondness for books, greatly dreaded his arrival, thinking within
herself how many pranks she'd play off upon him, provided 'Lena
would lend a helping hand, which she much doubted. John Jr.,
too, who for a time, at least, was to be placed under Mr. Everett's
instruction, felt in no wise eager for his arrival, fearing, as he
told 'Lena that "between the 'old man' and the tutor, he would
be kept a little too straight for a gentleman of his habits;" and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
was with no particular emotions of pleasure that he and Anna saw
the stage stop before the gate one pleasant morning toward the
middle of November. Running to one of the front windows,
Carrie, 'Lena, and Anna watched their new teacher, each after her
own fashion commenting upon his appearance.</p>

<p>"Ugh," exclaimed Anna, "what a green, boyish looking thing!
I reckon nobody's going to be afraid of him."</p>

<p>"I say he's real handsome," said Carrie, who being thirteen
years of age, had already, in her own mind, practiced many a little
coquetry upon the stranger.</p>

<p>"I like him," was 'Lena's brief remark.</p>

<p>Mr. Everett was a pale, intellectual looking man, scarcely
twenty years of age, and appearing still younger so that Anna
was not wholly wrong when she called him boyish. Still there
was in his large black eye a firmness and decision which bespoke
the man strong within him, and which put to flight all of Anna's
preconceived notions of rebellion. With the utmost composure he
returned Mrs. Livingstone's greeting, and the proud lady half bit
her lip with vexation as she saw how little he seemed awed by her
presence.</p>

<p>Malcolm Everett was not one to acknowledge superiority where
there was none, and though ever polite toward Mrs. Livingstone,
there was something in his manner which forbade her treating
him as aught save an equal. He was not to be trampled down,
and for once in her life Mrs. Livingstone had found a person who
would neither cringe to her nor flatter. The children were not
presented to him until dinner time, when, with the air of a young
desperado, John Jr. marched into the dining-room, eyeing his
teacher askance, calculating his strength, and returning his greeting
with a simple nod. Mr. Everett scanned him from head to
foot, and then turned to Carrie half smiling at the great dignity
which she assumed. With Lena and Anna he seemed better
pleased, holding their hands and smiling down upon them through
rows of teeth which Anna pronounced the whitest she had ever
seen.</p>

<p>Mr. Livingstone was not at home, and when his mother appeared,
Mrs. Livingstone did not think proper to introduce her.
But if by this omission she thought to keep the old lady silent, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
was mistaken, for the moment Mrs. Nichols was seated, she commenced
with, "Your name is Everett, I b'lieve?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," said he, bowing very gracefully toward her.</p>

<p>"Any kin to the governor what was?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am, none whatever," and the white teeth became
slightly visible for a moment, but soon disappeared.</p>

<p>"You are from Rockford, 'Lena tells me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am. Have you friends there?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;or that is, Nancy Scovandyke's sister, Betsy Scovandyke
that used to be, lives there. Maybe you know her. Her
name is Bacon&mdash;Betsy Bacon. She's a widder and keeps boarders."</p>

<p>"Ah," said he, the teeth this time becoming wholly visible,
"I've heard of Mrs. Bacon, but have not the honor of her acquaintance.
You are from the east, I perceive."</p>

<p>"Law, now! how did you know that?" asked Mrs. Nichols,
while Mr. Everett answered, "I <i>guessed</i> at it," with a peculiar
emphasis on the word guessed, which led 'Lena to think he had
used it purposely and not from habit.</p>

<p>Mr. Everett possessed in a remarkable degree the faculty of
making those around him both respect and like him, and ere six
weeks had passed, he had won the love of all his pupils. Even
John Jr. was greatly improved, and Carrie seemed suddenly reawakened
into a thirst for knowledge, deeming no task too long,
and no amount of study too hard, if it won the commendation of
the teacher. 'Lena, who committed to memory with great ease,
and who consequently did not deserve so much credit for her always
perfect lessons, seldom received a word of praise, while poor
Anna, notoriously lazy when books were concerned, cried almost
every day, because as she said, "Mr. Everett didn't like her as he
did the rest, else why did he look at her so much, watching her
all the while, and keeping her after school to get her lessons over,
when he knew how she hated them."</p>

<p>Once Mrs. Livingstone ventured to remonstrate, telling him
that Anna was very sensitive, and required altogether different
treatment from Carrie. "She thinks you dislike her," said she,
"and while she retains this impression, she will do nothing as far
as learning is concerned; so if you do not like her, try and make
her think you do!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a peculiar look in Mr. Everett's dark eyes as he answered,
"You may think it strange, Mrs. Livingstone, but of all
my pupils I love Anna the best! I know I find more fault with
her, and am, perhaps, more severe with her than with the rest,
but it's because I would make her what I wish her to be. Pardon
me, madam, but Anna does not possess the same amount of intellect
with her cousin or sister, but by proper culture she will
make a fine, intelligent woman."</p>

<p>Mrs. Livingstone hardly relished being told that one child was
inferior to the other, but she could not well help herself&mdash;Mr.
Everett would say what he pleased&mdash;and thus the conference
ended. From that time Mr. Everett was exceedingly kind to
Anna, wiping away the tears which invariably came when told
that she must stay with him in the schoolroom after the rest were
gone; then, instead of seating himself in rigid silence at a distance
until her task was learned, he would sit by her side, occasionally
smoothing her long curls and speaking encouragingly to
her as she poured over some hard rule of grammar, or puzzled her
brains with some difficult problem in Colburn. Ere long the result
of all this became manifest. Anna grew fonder of her books,
more ready to learn, and&mdash;more willing to be kept after school!</p>

<p>Ah, little did Mrs. Livingstone think what she was doing when
she bade young Malcolm Everett make her warm-hearted, impulsive
daughter <i>think</i> he liked her!</p>

<p>Mrs. Rosa Vertner Jeffrey, one of the most beautiful of
Kentucky women, whose personal loveliness has caused
some critics to forget she was a gifted poet, was born at
Natchez, Mississippi, in 1828, the daughter of John Y.
Griffith, a writer of considerable reputation in his day.
Her mother died when she was but nine months old, and
she was reared by her aunt. When Rosa was ten years of
age her adopted parents removed to Lexington, Kentucky,
where she was educated at the Episcopal Seminary. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
1845 Miss Vertner&mdash;she had taken the name of her foster
parents&mdash;was married to Claude M. Johnson, a wealthy
citizen of Lexington, and she at once took her place as a
great social and literary leader. One of her sons, Mr.
Claude M. Johnson, was mayor of Lexington for several
years, and he was afterwards in the service of the United
States government. In 1861 Mrs. Johnson's husband
died, and she removed to Rochester, New York, where she
resided for two years, when she was married to Alexander
Jeffrey, of Edinburgh, Scotland, and they returned to
Lexington, her home for the remainder of her life. Mrs.
Jeffrey died at Lexington, Kentucky, October 6, 1894, and
no woman has yet arisen in Kentucky to take her position
as society's favorite beauty and poet. She began her literary
career as a contributor of verse to Prentice's <i>Louisville
Journal</i>. Her pen-name was "Rosa," and under this
name her first volume of poems was published, entitled
<i>Poems, by Rosa</i> (Boston, 1857). This was followed by
<i>Florence Vale</i>; <i>Woodburn</i>, a novel; <i>Daisy Dare and Baby
Power</i> (Philadelphia, 1871), a book of poems; <i>The Crimson
Hand and Other Poems</i> (Philadelphia, 1881), her best
known work; and <i>Marah</i> (Philadelphia, 1884), a novel.
Mrs. Jeffrey was also the author of a five-act comedy,
called <i>Love and Literature</i>. As a novelist or playwright
she did nothing especially strong, but as a writer of pleasing
poems her place in the literature of Kentucky seems
secure.</p>

<h2><a name="SALLIE_R_FORD" id="SALLIE_R_FORD">SALLIE R. FORD</a></h2>


<p>Mrs. Sallie Rochester Ford, the mother of good <i>Grace
Truman</i>, was born at Rochester Springs, near Danville,
Kentucky, in 1828. Miss Rochester was graduated from
the female seminary at Georgetown, Kentucky, in 1849,
and six years later she was married to Rev. Samuel H.
Ford (1823-1905), a Baptist preacher and editor of Louisville<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
and St. Louis. She was her husband's associate in
his literary enterprises, rendering him excellent service
at all times. Her last years were spent at St. Louis,
in which city she died in February, 1910, having rounded
out more than four score years. Mrs. Ford's religious
novel, <i>Grace Truman, or Love and Principle</i> (New
York, 1857) attracted wide attention in its day, and it
was reprinted many times. It was read by thousands
of young girls; and ministers descanted upon it in their
sermons. While the work sets forth that the Baptist road
is the only right of way to heaven, and is sentimental to
the core, it is fairly well-written, and it undoubtedly did
much good. A copy of it may be found in almost any collection
of Kentucky books. <i>Grace Truman</i> was followed
by <i>Mary Bunyan</i> (New York, 1859); <i>Morgan and His
Men</i> (Mobile, Ala., 1864); <i>Ernest Quest</i> (New York,
1877); <i>Evangel Wiseman</i> (1907); and Mrs. Ford's final
work, published at St. Louis, <i>The Life of Rochester Ford,
the Successful Christian Lawyer</i>.</p>

<p class="center">OUR MINISTER MARRIES</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>Grace Truman</i> (St. Louis, 1886)]</p>

<p>May roses fling abroad their rich fragrance on the evening air!
May dews glide noiselessly to the newly awakened earth, and lose
themselves in her fresh, green bosom. A soft May moon steals
above the eastern horizon, and gilds with radiant luster the brow
of night. Gentle May zephyrs from their airy home glide over
the earth, kissing the lips of the rose, and the tender cheek of the
hedge-row violet. Young and tender May leaves whisper to each
other tales of love, away, away, in the dark old forests.</p>

<p>And other lips than those of the dancing leaves have whispered
tales of love; and mortal ears have heard its sweet low
murmurings; and mortal hearts have felt its thrilling inspiration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
until the soul, fired beneath its ecstatic power, has tasted of bliss
which mortal tongue can never say.</p>

<p>In the hospitable mansion of Mr. Gray, all is excitement and
expectancy. She to whom their hearts were so closely wedded,
the living, joyous Annie, is tonight to take upon her the marriage
vow. She is to wed the man of her heart's free choice, the object
of her pure unsullied love. She is to stand in the presence of
God and many witnesses, and promise to love and cherish, yea as
long as life shall last, him upon whom she has bestowed her girlhood's
fresh full confidence and affection.</p>

<p>The house is brilliantly lighted throughout, and everything
bears the testimony of free Kentucky hospitality. 'Tis but the
twilight hour&mdash;early, yet the guests are fast assembling.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was a simple yet beautiful and impressive scene&mdash;that little
group as it stood, while the aged man of God, in a solemn and
touching manner, united in indissoluble ties the two warm loving
hearts before him. The vailed form of the bride, leaning on the
arm of him who was henceforth to be her earthly stay; the calm
dignified form, and earnest, we might say, almost holy expression
of him who was receiving the precious trust&mdash;the bent form, and
hoary locks, and tremulous voice of the minister&mdash;all conspired
to make the scene one of solemn beauty and intense interest.</p>

<p>Congratulations followed, and many were the kisses that
pressed the blushing cheek of the happy bride, who, with her vail
thrown back from her brow and the color playing over her bright
face "like moonlight over streams," looked the very embodiment
of grace and loveliness.</p>

<p>Fannie calmly waited till the excitement was measurably over;
and then approaching her new cousin, leaning on the arm of Mr.
Ray, gave them each a fervent kiss and her warmest wishes for
their future happiness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The time passed most delightfully to all present. Mr. and
Mrs. Gray moved about among the guests dispensing pleasure
and enjoyment wherever they went. But the bride and bridegroom
were the chief attraction; she, with her naturally exuberant
spirits, heightened by the excitement of the occasion, and yet
tempered by her husband's dignified cheerfulness; and he, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
his fine conversational powers and affable manner, drew around
them an admiring crowd wherever they were. The young ladies
and gentlemen promenaded and chatted gayly, while the more
elderly ones grouped themselves together in different parts of the
room for the purpose of social conversation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Supper was served in liberal, handsome style; and Mr. and
Mrs. Gray, assisted by Mr. and Mrs. Truman, attended to the
wants of their guests in the most obliging and attentive manner.
And when the hour arrived for the company to disperse to their
respective homes, each one went away happy in the thoughts of
having passed a most agreeable hour.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Gray accompanied their daughter to Weston the
day after the wedding, when they met with a most welcome reception
from Mr. and Mrs. Holmes, who had provided an evening
entertainment for the bridal party, and had called together many
of their friends.</p>

<p>They remained several days, during which time they saw their
daughter nicely and comfortably ensconced in a neat little brick
cottage, situated in a very pleasant part of the village, and which
was henceforth called "The Parsonage."</p>

<p>Annie, or, we should rather say, Mrs. Lewis, united with the
little church of which her husband was now the almost idolized
pastor, on the Saturday after her marriage. It had been so arranged
by Mr. Lewis that they should be married on Tuesday
previous to their church meeting, that she might thus soon cast
her lot among his people. She was welcomed with warm hearts
and affectionate greeting; and when, on the following morning,
her husband led her down into the stream, where but a few
months before he had followed Christ in baptism, they received
her from the liquid grave, a member of the household of faith,
a laborer with them in the vineyard of the Lord.</p>

<h2><a name="JOHN_E_HATCHER" id="JOHN_E_HATCHER">JOHN E. HATCHER</a></h2>


<p>Col. John E. Hatcher ("G. Washington Bricks"), a
newspaper humorist who won wide fame in his day and
generation, but who is now quite sealed over and forgotten,
was born near Charlottesville, Virginia, in 1828.
When a boy his parents emigrated to Tennessee. At the
age of twenty years Hatcher became editor of <i>The American
Democrat</i> at Florence, Alabama; and in 1852 he purchased
<i>The Mirror</i>, a paper which General Zollicoffer had
established at Columbia, Tennessee. Some time later
Hatcher disposed of that property, and accepted a position
on the <i>Nashville Patriot</i>. He was fast gaining a
reputation for his humorous sketches, paragraphs, and
rhymes, which were floating through many Southern
newspapers under his pen-name of "G. Washington
Bricks." Hatcher relinquished the pen for the sword
when the Civil War began, becoming an officer on the staff
of General Cheatham. After the war, or in 1867, Colonel
Hatcher settled at Louisville, Kentucky, joining the staff
of Prentice's then fast-expiring <i>Journal</i>. When, in the
following year, the <i>Journal</i> was united with the <i>Courier</i>,
he became editor of the <i>Daily Democrat</i>; and when that
paper was consolidated with the other two to make <i>The
Courier-Journal</i>, he became one of the editors of the new
paper, and continued to write for it so long as he lived.
For a short time he did some special work for a Louisville
publication known as <i>The Evening Express</i>, conducted
by Mr. Overton. A few years before his death
Colonel Hatcher returned to his old home at Columbia,
Tennessee, and founded <i>The Mail</i>; but he became "outside
editor" of <i>The Courier-Journal</i>, laying down his pen
for that paper only with his death, which occurred at
Columbia, Tennessee, March 26, 1879. Consumption
caused his demise and robbed Southern journalism of one
of its finest minds. Colonel Hatcher married Miss Lizzie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
McKnight, daughter of a prosperous merchant at Iuka,
Mississippi, and the early death of their only child, a
daughter, coupled with consumption, hastened his own
death. As an editorial paragraphist Colonel Hatcher has
never had a peer in Kentucky or the South. Prentice, the
father of the paragraph, was a wit; Hatcher was a humorist;
and his writings were often credited to Prentice by
those who were not acquainted with the inner workings of
the office. Henry Watterson has written this fine tribute
to Colonel Hatcher's memory:</p>

<p>He was one of the silent singers of the press, but he lacked nothing
of eminence except good fortune; for he was a humorist of the
very first water, and had he lived under different conditions could
not have failed of the celebrity to which his talents entitled him.
Born not merely poor, but far inland, with no early advantages,
and later in life with none except those furnished by a rural newspaper;
ill health overtook him before he had divined his own
powers.... His wit was not so aggressive as that of Mr. Prentice.
But he had more humor. He died in the prime of life and
left behind him a professional tradition, which is cherished by
the little circle of friends to whom a charming personality and
many brilliant gifts made him very dear.</p>

<p>"The New York <i>Telegraph</i> advises people to marry for love and

will always be in want of money if you marry for love, and always

is to marry for a little of both.</p>

<p>Some of our contemporaries will persist in speaking of us as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
"rebel." That we fought for the stars and bars with a heroism
of which Marathon, Leuctra, and Thermopylae never even
dreamed, the bones of half-a-dozen substitutes which lie bleeding
upon as many "stormy heights and carnage covered fields" bear
testimony abundant and indisputable, and that we suffer ourselves
still to be called a "rebel" without unsheathing the avenging
dagger and wading up to our knees in gore, is simply because
there is already as much blood upon the hands of our substitutes
as we can furnish soap to wash off without becoming a bankrupt.
Nevertheless, if this thing is much longer persisted in, there may
come a time when virtue will cease to be a forebearance. One
more taste of blood, this sanguinary arm once more uplifted to
smite, and the world will shudder.</p>

of her palpitating stays in the other, and "with a lip unused to

than a deaf and dumb orang-outang has of metaphysics.
Even without the pipe and whiskey there is, strictly speaking,

<h2><a name="WILLIAM_C_WATTS" id="WILLIAM_C_WATTS">WILLIAM C. WATTS</a></h2>


<p>William Courtney Watts, author of a single historical
novel which is regarded by many as the finest work of its
kind yet done by a Kentucky hand, was born at Salem, Kentucky,
February 7, 1830. His family has no record of his
school days, but he was married to Miss Nannie Ferguson
when a young man, and six children were born to them.
Watts's early years were spent at Salem and Smithland,
Kentucky, but he later went to New Orleans as a clerk in
the firm of Givens, Watts and Company, cotton brokers.
He shortly afterwards joined the New York branch of this
New Orleans house, known as Watts, Crowe and Company,
as a partner in the business; and from New York
Watts went to Liverpool, England, to represent the firm of
W. C. Watts and Company, which was the foreign title for
the New Orleans and New York houses. For some years
the business was very prosperous, and Watts, of course,
shared largely in the firm's success. After the usual congratulatory
messages between England and the United
States had been exchanged, Watts is said to have sent the
first cablegram across the Atlantic. After many years of
prosperity, failure overtook the house of Watts, and he
returned to New York, setting up in business with a Mr.
Slaughter. Some time subsequently he came back to
Kentucky, making his home in Smithland, but rheumatism
ruined his health, causing lameness, and making
him an invalid for the remainder of his life. In Smithland,
during days of illness, Watts wrote his splendid
story, <i>The Chronicles of a Kentucky Settlement</i> (New
York, 1897). This novel of early Kentucky life is one of
the most charming and delightful tales ever told by an
American author, although founded upon fact and, in a
sense, twice-told. <i>The Chronicles</i> is the only book Watts
wrote, and he has come down to posterity with this single
story in his feeble hand. The preface, signed on the sixty-seventh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
anniversary of his birth, was done but ten
months before his death, which occurred at Smithland,
Kentucky December 27, 1897. He is buried in the cemetery
of the little Kentucky town over which he cast the
glamour of romance, almost unknown to its citizen of this
day, and still unappreciated and unheralded by Kentuckians.
His <i>Chronicles</i> is known only to the student and
collector, as it was never properly put before the public,
though published by a powerful New York firm. His
family knows little of his life and is quite careless of his
fame. In years to come the <i>Chronicles</i> may take high
rank among the finest series of historical pictures ever
penned of a single Southern settlement, and then William
Courtney Watts will come into his very own.</p>

<p class="center">A WEDDING AND A DANCE<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p class="center">[From <i>Chronicles of a Kentucky Settlement</i> (New York, 1897)]</p>

<p>A few weeks after the race there was a grand wedding, and,
this time, Squire Howard united in holy matrimony Jefferson
Brantley and Emily Wilmot, the ceremony taking place at the
residence of the bride's father. Joseph Adair and Horace Benton
were the groomsmen, and Laura Howard and Ada Howard
the bridesmaids. A young lady from Princeton was to have been
one of the bridesmaids, but illness prevented her attendance, and
Ada Howard took her place. The residence of Mr. Wilmot was
too small to admit of dancing, but the company present had a
merry time&mdash;the fun and frolic being kept up until a late hour.
It was then the custom to "give" (hold) the infare at the residence
of the groom's parents or some other near relative, but, as
Mr. Brantley had no relatives in the county, his infare was held
at the Brick Hotel in Salem, and great were the preparations made
on the occasion&mdash;never had such an elegant and sumptuous
table been spread in those "parts"; there were meats of many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
sorts, including barbacued pigs, and cakes, pastries, fruits, nuts,
and wines and liquors in abundance. Silas Holman and Billy
Wilmot were never in better trim, and their fiddles seemed the
fountain of such ecstatic sounds as to set the nerves of old as well
as young tingling with a pleasurable excitement which could only
find its true expression in the quick and graceful movements of
the dance. And dancing there was, and such dancing! There
was Bird McCoy, who could "cut the double shuffle,"&mdash;spring
into the air, strike his feet together thrice before lighting, and
not lose step to the music. And among the young ladies&mdash;many
of them country girls whose lives in the open air made them
as active as squirrels and as graceful as fawns&mdash;were many good
dancers, but it was conceded that among them all the slight,
sylph-like Ada Howard was the best&mdash;"the pick of the flock."
And the mirth and fun grew "fast and furious," and the "dancers
quick and quicker flew." Nor did the fun and frolic cease
until faint streaks of light in the East heralded the coming morn.
They almost literally</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Danced all night 'til broad daylight,<br /></span>
<span class="i05">And went home with the girls in the morning."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And yet, be it said that, while there was a good deal of drinking
that night, there was no drunkenness, rowdyism, unseemly behavior,
or ungentlemanly conversation; for woe to the young
man who at such a time and place, when ladies were present, had
violated the recognized rules of decorum!</p>

<p>It is certain, however, that several young persons came very
near that night being "fiddled out of the church." There
was one gay, good-humored, hearty country girl who, when
"churched" for dancing that night, admitted that she was "on
the floor with the so-called dancers"; that she had a "partner,"
and took part in the movements; but, she contended, that inasmuch
as she had not <i>crossed her feet</i>, she had violated no rule of
the church. "What," she asked, "if I walk forward and backward
and turn and bow <i>without</i> music, is that dancing? And
if I do the same when there <i>is</i> music, does that make it dancing?"
And the good old brethren, who were sitting in judgment, after
mature deliberation, came to the conclusion that they were not
"cl'ar on the p'int 'bout crossin' the feet." "And," said one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
"if we err, let it be on the side o' marcy." "Yes," replied another,
"but let the young sister understand that she must n't do
it ag'in." And so the matter was settled.</p>

reputation as an orator and humorist, but which injured
him as a constructive statesman&mdash;if he ever was or could
be such a statesman! Knott was in Congress again from
1875 until 1883, when he was elected governor of Kentucky.
Governor Knott was not an overly forceful executive,
but the people enjoyed his witty stories and speeches,
and thus his term wore on and out. It was an era of good
feeling, Kentuckians smiling and taking their governor
good naturedly at all times. His brief eulogy to remember
James Francis Leonard, the Kentucky telegrapher,
was the finest literary thing he did while governor of Kentucky.
The governor was dean of the law faculty of Centre
College, Danville, Kentucky, from 1894 to 1901, when,
old age coming on, he returned to his home at Lebanon,
where the final years of his life were passed, and where
he died on June 18, 1911.</p>

<p class="center">FROM THE DULUTH SPEECH</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>Oddities in Southern Life and Character</i>, edited by Henry Watterson
(Boston, 1883)]</p>

<p>Hence, as I have said, sir, I was utterly at a loss to determine
where the terminus of this great and indispensable road should
be, until I accidentally overheard some gentleman the other day
mention the name of "Duluth." [Great laughter.] Duluth!
The word fell upon my ear with peculiar and indescribable
charm, like the gentle murmur of a low fountain stealing forth
in the midst of roses, or the soft, sweet accents of an angel's
whisper in the bright, joyous dream of sleeping innocence. Duluth!
'Twas the name for which my soul had panted for years,
as the hart panteth for the water-brooks. [Renewed laughter.]
But where was Duluth? Never, in all my limited reading, had
my vision been gladdened by seeing the celestial word in print.
[Laughter.] And I felt a profounder humiliation in my ignorance
that its dulcet syllables had never before ravished my
delighted ear. [Roars of laughter.] I was certain the draughtsman
of this bill had never heard of it, or it would have been designated
as one of the termini of this road. I asked my friends
about it, but they knew nothing of it. I rushed to the library
and examined all the maps I could find. [Laughter.] I discovered
in one of them a delicate, hair-like line, diverging from
the Mississippi near a place marked Prescott, which I supposed
was intended to represent the river St. Croix, but I could nowhere
find Duluth.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I was confident it existed somewhere, and that
its discovery would constitute the crowning glory of the present
century, if not of all modern times. [Laughter.] I knew it
was bound to exist in the very nature of things; that the symmetry
and perfection of our planetary system would be incomplete
without it [renewed laughter]; that the elements of material
nature would long since have resolved themselves back into
original chaos if there had been such a hiatus in creation as would
have resulted from leaving out Duluth. [Roars of laughter.]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
In fact, sir, I was overwhelmed with the conviction that Duluth
not only existed somewhere, but that wherever it was it was a
great and glorious place. I was convinced that the greatest
calamity that ever befell the benighted nations of the ancient
world was in their having passed away without a knowledge of
the actual existence of Duluth; that their fabled Atlantis, never
seen save by the hallowed vision of inspired poesy, was, in fact,
but another name for Duluth; that the golden orchard of the
Hesperides was but a poetical synonym for the beer gardens in
the vicinity of Duluth. [Great laughter.] I was certain that
Herodotus had died a miserable death because in all his travels
and with all his geographical research he had never heard of
Duluth. [Laughter.] I knew that if the immortal spirit of
Homer could look down from another heaven than that created
by his own celestial genius upon the long lines of pilgrims from
every nation of the earth to the gushing fountain of poesy opened
by the touch of his magic wand; if he could be permitted to
behold the vast assemblage of grand and glorious productions of
the lyric art called into being by his own inspired strains, he
would weep tears of bitter anguish that, instead of lavishing all
the stores of his mighty genius upon the fall of Ilion, it had not
been his more blessed lot to crystalize in deathless song the rising
glories of Duluth. [Great and continued laughter.] Yet, sir,
had it not been for this map, kindly furnished me by the legislature
of Minnesota, I might have gone down to my obscure and
humble grave in an agony of despair, because I could nowhere
find Duluth. [Renewed laughter.] Had such been my melancholy
fate, I have no doubt that, with the last feeble pulsation of
my breaking heart, with the last faint exhalation of my fleeting
breath, I should have whispered, "Where is Duluth?" [Roars of
laughter.]</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="GEORGE_G_VEST" id="GEORGE_G_VEST">GEORGE G. VEST</a></h2>


<p>George Graham Vest, exquisite eulogist of man's good
friend, the dog, was born at Frankfort, Kentucky, December
6, 1830. At the age of eighteen years Vest was
graduated from Centre College, Danville, Kentucky; and
five years later Transylvania University granted him
his degree in law. The year of his graduation from
Transylvania, 1853, Vest went to Missouri, settling at
Georgetown. He rapidly attained a State-wide reputation
as a lawyer and orator. In 1860 he was a presidential
elector on the Democratic ticket, and a member of
the Missouri House of Representatives. Vest's sympathy
lay with the South and he resigned his seat in the
legislature in order to become a member of the Confederate
Congress. He served two years in the Confederate
House and one year in the Senate. After the war
he resumed the practice of his profession at Sedalia, but
he later removed to Kansas City. In 1878 Vest was
elected United States Senator from Missouri and this
position he held until 1903. In the Senate his powers as
an orator and debater were generally recognized, and he
became a national figure. Of the many speeches that
Senator Vest made, his tribute to the dog, made in a jury
trial, is the one thing that will keep his memory green
for many years. It appears that Senator Vest was called
into a case in which one party was endeavoring to recover
damages for the death of a favorite dog, and when it
came time for him to speak he arose and delivered his
tribute to the dog, and then resumed his seat without
having mentioned the case before the jury in any way
whatsoever. The jury understood however, and the Senator
won his case. Senator Vest died at Sweet Springs,
Missouri, August 9, 1904.</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>The Writings of Thomas Jefferson</i> (Washington, 1905, v. xii)]</p>

<p>Upon the canvas of the past, Washington and Jefferson stand
forth the central figures in our struggle for independence. The
character of the former was so rounded and justly proportioned,
that, so long as our country lives, or a single community of Americans
can be found, Washington will be "First in war, first in
peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen."</p>

<p>To Washington we are more indebted than to any one man for
national existence; but what availed the heroism of Bunker Hill,
the sufferings of Valley Forge, or the triumph of Yorktown, if the
government they established had been but an imitation of the
monarchy from which we had separated?</p>

<p>To Jefferson we owe eternal gratitude for his sublime confidence
in popular government, and his unfaltering courage in
defending at all times and in all places, the great truth, that "All
governments derive their just powers from the consent of the
governed."</p>

<p>The love of liberty is found not in palaces, but with the poor
and oppressed. It flutters in the heart of the caged bird, and
sighs with the worn and wasted prisoner in his dungeon. It has
gone with martyrs to the stake, and kissed their burning lips as
the tortured spirit winged its flight to God!</p>

<p>In the temple of this deity Jefferson was high priest!</p>

<p>For myself, I worship no mortal man living or dead; but if I
could kneel at such a shrine, it would be with uncovered head
and loving heart at the grave of Thomas Jefferson.</p>


<p class="center">EULOGY OF THE DOG</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>Library of Southern Literature</i> (Atlanta, 1910, v. xii)]</p>

<p>Gentlemen of the Jury:</p>

<p>The best human friend a man has in the world may turn
against him and become his enemy. His son or daughter that
he has reared with loving care may prove ungrateful. Those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
who are nearest and dearest to us, those whom we trust with our
happiness and our good name may become traitors to their faith.
The money that a man has he may lose. It flies away from him,
perhaps, when he needs it most. A man's reputation may be
sacrificed in a moment of ill-considered action. The people who
are prone to fall on their knees to do us honor when success is
with us may be the first to throw the stone of malice when failure
settles its cloud upon our heads. The one absolutely unselfish
friend that a man can have in this selfish world, the one that
never deceives him, the one that never proves ungrateful and
treacherous is his dog.</p>

<p>A man's dog stands by him in prosperity and in poverty, in
health and in sickness. He will sleep on the cold ground where
the wintry wind blows and the snow drifts fiercely, if only he may
be near his master's side. He will kiss the hand that has no food
to offer. He will lick the wounds and sores that come in encounter
with the roughness of the world. He guards the sleep of
his pauper master as if he were a prince. When all other friends
desert he remains. When riches take wings and reputation falls
to pieces, he is as constant in his love as the sun in its journeys
through the heavens. If fortune drives the master forth an outcast
in the world, friendless and homeless, the faithful dog asks
no higher privilege than that of accompanying, to guard against
danger, to fight against his enemies, and when, the last scene of
all comes and when death takes the master in its embrace and his
body is laid away in the cold ground, no matter if all other
friends pursue their way, there by the graveside may the noble
dog be found, his head between his paws, his eyes sad but open
in alert watchfulness, faithful and true even in death.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="WILLIAM_P_JOHNSTON" id="WILLIAM_P_JOHNSTON">WILLIAM P. JOHNSTON</a></h2>


<p>William Preston Johnston, biographer and poet, was
born at Louisville, Kentucky, January 5, 1831, the son of
the famous Confederate general, Albert Sidney Johnston.
He was graduated from Yale in 1852. During the Civil
War young Johnston was on the staff of Jefferson Davis.
After the war he was professor of history and literature
in Washington and Lee University, Lexington, Virginia,
for ten years. In 1880 he accepted the presidency of
Louisiana State University, at Baton Rouge. Paul Tulane's
magnificent gift in 1883 made Tulane University
possible, and Johnston became its first president. This
position he held until his death, which occurred at New
Orleans, July 16, 1899. President Johnston's <i>Life of
General Albert Sidney Johnston</i> (New York, 1878), is one
of the most admirable biographies ever written by a Kentuckian.
His graphic description of the battle of Shiloh,
in which his famous father met death and the South defeat,
is now accepted, even in the North, as the best account
of that desperate conflict. Had General Johnston
lived a day longer no one can even guess what it would
have meant to the South and to the North. President
Johnston was also the author of <i>The Prototype of Hamlet</i>
(1890), in which his power as a Shakesperian scholar is
well proved; and he published <i>The Johnstons of Salisbury</i>.
He was a maker of charming verse, which may be
read in his three collections, <i>My Garden Walk</i> (1894),
<i>Pictures of the Patriarchs</i> (1896), and <i>Seekers After God</i>
(Louisville, 1898), a book of sonnets. As a man, Johnston
was a true type of the courtly Southern soldier and
scholar.</p>

<p class="center">BATTLE OF SHILOH&mdash;SUNDAY MORNING</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>The Life of Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston</i> (New York, 1879)]</p>

<p>Saturday afternoon, April 5th, the sun, breaking through the
mists which drifted away, set in a cloudless sky. The night was
clear, calm, and beautiful. General Johnston, tired out with the
vigils of the night before, slept quietly in an ambulance-wagon,
his staff bivouacking by the camp-fires around him. Some of
Hardee's troops having wasted their rations, he and Bragg spent
a large part of the night getting up provisions for them. Before
the faintest glimmer of dawn, the wide forest was alive with
preparations for the mighty contest of the coming day. No
bugle-note sounded, and no drum beat the reveill; but men took
their hasty morning meal, and looked with sharp attention to the
arms that were to decide the fortunes of the fight. The cool,
gray dawn found them in motion. Morning opened with all the
delicate fragrance and beauty of the season, enhanced by the
contrast of the day before. The sky was serene, the air was
bracing, the dew lay heavy on the tender green of leaf and herb,
and the freshness of early spring was on all around. When the
sun rose it was with unclouded brilliancy; and, as it shed its
glories over the coverts of the oak-woods, the advancing host,
stirred by the splendor of the scene and the enthusiasm of the
hour, passed the omen from lip to lip, and welcomed its rising as
another "sun of Austerlitz."</p>

<p>The native buoyance of General Johnston's self-repressed temper
broke its barriers at the prospect of that struggle which
should settle for all time by the arbitrament of arms the dispute
as to his own military ability and skill and the fate of the Confederate
cause in the West. He knew the hazard; but he knew,
too, that he had done all that foresight, fortitude, energy, and
strategy, could accomplish to secure a victory, and he welcomed
with exultant joy the day that was about to decide not only these
great questions, but for him all questions, solving the mysteries
of life and death. Men who came within his influence on the
battle-field felt and confessed the inspiration of his presence, his
manner, and his words. As he gave his orders in terse sentences,
every word seemed to ring with a presage of victory.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>Turning to his staff, as he mounted, he exclaimed, "Tonight we
will water our horses in the Tennessee River." It was thus that
he formulated his plan of battle. It must not stop short of
entire victory.</p>

<p>As he rode forward he encountered Colonel Randal L. Gibson,
who was the intimate friend of his son. When Gibson ordered
his brigade to salute, General Johnston took him warmly by the
hand and said: "Randal, I never see you but I think of William.
I hope you may get through safely to-day, but we must
win a victory." Gibson says he felt greatly stirred by his words.</p>

<p>Sharp skirmishing had begun before he reached the front.
Here he met Colonel John S. Marmaduke, commanding the Third
Arkansas Regiment. This officer, in reply to General Johnston's
questions, explained, with some pride, that he held the <i>centre</i> of
the front line, the other regiments forming on him. Marmaduke
had been with General Johnston in Utah, at Bowling Green,
and in the retreat to Corinth, and regarded him with the entire
affection and veneration of a young soldier for his master in the
art of war. General Johnston put his hand on Marmaduke's
shoulder, and said to him with an earnestness that went to his
heart, "<i>My son</i>, we must this day conquer or perish!" Marmaduke
felt himself moved to a tenfold resolution.</p>

<p>General Johnston said to the ambitious Hindman, who had
been in the vanguard from the beginning: "You have <i>earned</i>
your spurs as major-general. Let this day's work win them."</p>

<p>"Men of Arkansas!" he exclaimed to a regiment from that
State, "they say you boast of your prowess with the bowie-knife.
To-day you wield a nobler weapon&mdash;the bayonet. Employ it
well." It was with such words, as he rode from point to point,
that he raised a spirit in that host which swept away the serried
lines of the conquerors of Donelson.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="WILL_WALLACE_HARNEY" id="WILL_WALLACE_HARNEY">WILL WALLACE HARNEY</a></h2>


<p>Will Wallace Harney, poet, was born at Bloomington,
Indiana, June 20, 1832, the son of John H. Harney, professor
of mathematics in the University of Indiana, and
author of the first <i>Algebra</i> edited by an American.
When the future poet was seven years of age his father
removed to Louisville, Kentucky, to accept the presidency
of Louisville College. In 1844 President Harney became
editor of the Louisville <i>Daily Democrat</i>, which he conducted
for nearly twenty-five years. Will Wallace Harney
was educated by the old grammarian, Noble Butler,
and at Louisville College. He became a teacher in the
public schools of the city, in which he taught for five years;
and he was the first principal of the high school there,
holding the position for two years. Know-Nothingism
then swept the city and elected a new board of trustees,
which requested Harney's resignation. He was appointed
to a professorship in the State Normal School at Lexington,
which he held for two years. He then returned
to Louisville to practice law, but he was shortly afterwards
asked to become assistant editor of the <i>Daily Democrat</i>;
and after his father's death, in 1867, he became
editor of that paper. Harney's masterpiece, <i>The Stab</i>,
that John J. Piatt called "a tragic little night-piece which
Heine could not have surpassed in its simple, graphic
narration and vivid suggestiveness," was written in Kentucky
before 1860. In 1869 Harney removed to Florida,
where he planted an orange grove and wrote for the high-class
magazines and newspapers of the East and South.
From 1883 to 1885 he was editor of <i>The Bitter Sweet</i>, a
newspaper of Kissimmee. Harney spent the final years
of his life with his only son, William R. Harney, a business
man of Jacksonville, to whom he inscribed his one
book, <i>The Spirit of the South</i> (Boston, 1909). This volume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
brought together his poems and short stories which
he cared to preserve from newspapers and periodicals.
The poet died at Jacksonville, Florida, March 28, 1912.</p>

<p>Josiah Stoddard Johnston, journalist and historian, was
born at New Orleans, February 10, 1833. He is the nephew
of the celebrated Confederate cavalry leader, General
Albert Sidney Johnston. Left an orphan when but five
years old, he was reared by relatives in Kentucky. He
was graduated from Yale in 1853; and the following year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
he was married to Miss Elizabeth W. Johnson, daughter
of George W. Johnson, Confederate governor of Kentucky.
Johnston was a cotton planter in Arkansas from
1855 to 1859, and a Kentucky farmer until the Civil War
began. He served throughout the war upon the staffs of
Generals Bragg, Buckner, and Breckinridge. Colonel
Johnston was editor of the old Frankfort <i>Yeoman</i> for
more than twenty years; and from 1903 to 1908 he was
associate editor of the Louisville <i>Courier-Journal</i>. In
1871 Colonel Johnston was Adjutant-General of Kentucky;
and Secretary of State from 1875 to 1879. He
has been vice-president of the Filson Club of Louisville
since 1893; and he is now consulting geologist of the Kentucky
Geological Survey. Colonel Johnston's knowledge
of plants and mammals is very extensive and most surprising
in a man of literary tastes. His tube-roses and
flower gardens is one of the traditions of the old town of
Frankfort. Colonel Johnston has published <i>The Memorial
History of Louisville, Kentucky</i> (Chicago, 1896,
two vols.); <i>The First Explorations of Kentucky</i> (Louisville,
1898); and <i>The Confederate History of Kentucky</i>.
Colonel Johnston is one of the finest men in Kentucky to-day,
dignified, cultured, and deeply learned in the history
of Kentucky and the West.</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>First Explorations of Kentucky</i> (Louisville, Kentucky, 1898)]</p>

<p>The Revolutionary War was drawing to a close, involving Virginia
in its last throes in the devastation of an invading army.
The whole eastern portion was overrun by the British forces under
Arnold and Tarleton, the capital taken, and much public
and private property destroyed everywhere. Charlottesville, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
which the legislature had adjourned, Monticello, and Castle Hill
were raided by Tarleton's dragoons, and the legislature, Mr. Jefferson,
and Doctor Walker barely escaped capture. An interesting
incident of the raid is recorded well illustrating the spirit
which actuated the American women of that period. Not far distant
from Charlottesville, on an estate known as "The Farm,"
resided Nicholas Lewis, the uncle and guardian of Meriwether
Lewis, of the Lewis and Clark expedition to the Pacific. His wife
was Mary Walker, the eldest daughter of Doctor Walker. Her
husband was absent in the army when Tarleton with his raiders
swooped down on her home and proceeded to appropriate forage
and every thing eatable and portable. She received the British
cavalryman with spirit and dignity, and upbraided him sharply
for his war on defenseless women, telling him to go to the armies
of Virginia and meet her men. Tarleton parried her thrusts with
politeness as well as he could, and after his men were rested,
resumed his march.</p>

<p>After his departure Mrs. Lewis discovered that his men had
carried off all her ducks except a single old drake. This she
caused to be caught and sent it to Tarleton by a messenger, who
overtook him, with her compliments, saying that the drake was
lonesome without his companions, and as he had evidently overlooked
it, she wished to reunite them. From that time she was
known as "Captain Moll," and bears that sobriquet in the family
records. She was a woman of strong character, was still
living at "The Farm" in 1817, and left many descendants in
Virginia and in and near Louisville, Kentucky. On the 19th
of October, 1781, Tarleton's career closed, and Virginia was relieved
from similar devastation for a period of eighty years by the
surrender at Yorktown.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Julia Stockton Dinsmore ("F.V."), poet, was born
in Louisiana about 1833, but most of her long life of nearly
eighty years has been spent in Kentucky. For many years
Miss Dinsmore published an occasional poem in the
newspapers of her home town, Petersburg, Kentucky,
but, in 1910, when she was seventy-seven years of age,
the New York firm of Doubleday, Page and Company discovered
Miss Dinsmore to be a poet of much grace and
charm, and they at once issued the first collection of her
work, entitled "Verses and Sonnets." This little volume
contains more than eighty exquisite lyrics, which
have been favorably reviewed by the literary journals of
the country. <i>Love Among the Roses</i>, <i>Noon in a Blue
Grass Pasture</i>, <i>Far 'Mid the Snows</i>, <i>That's for Remembrance</i>,
and several of the sonnets are very fine. Miss
Dinsmore is a great lover of Nature, as her poems reveal,
and she is often in the saddle. A most remarkable woman
she surely is, having won the plaudits of her people when
most women of her years have their eyes turned toward

<h2><a name="HENRY_T_STANTON" id="HENRY_T_STANTON">HENRY T. STANTON</a></h2>


<p>Henry Thompson Stanton, one of the most popular poets
Kentucky has produced, was born at Alexandria, Virginia,
June 30, 1834. He was brought by his father,
Judge Richard Henry Stanton, to Maysville, Kentucky,
when he was only two years old. Stanton was educated
at the Maysville Academy and at West Point, but he was
not graduated. He entered the Confederate army as captain
of a company in the Fifth Kentucky regiment, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
through various promotions he surrendered as a major.
Major Stanton saw much service on the battlefields of
Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia. After the war he
practised law for a time and was editor of the Maysville
<i>Bulletin</i> until 1870, when he removed to Frankfort, Kentucky,
to become chief assistant to the State Commissioner
of Insurance. Major Stanton's first volume of verse
was <i>The Moneyless Man and Other Poems</i> (Baltimore,
1871). This title poem, written for a wandering elocutionist
who "struck" the town of Maysville one day, and
asked the major to write him "a poem that would draw
tears from any audience," made him famous and miserable
for the rest of his life. For the nomad he "dashed
off this special lyric and it brought all Kentucky to the
mourners' bench. It was more deadly as a tear-provoker
than 'Stay, Jailer, Stay,' and though the author wrote
other things which were far better, the public would never
admit it, and many people innocently courted death by
rushing up to Stanton and exclaiming: 'Oh, and is this
Major Stanton who wrote 'The Moneyless Man?' So
glad to meet you.'" One Kentucky poet took the philosophy
of <i>The Moneyless Man</i> too seriously, and <i>A Reply
to the Moneyless Man</i> was the pathetic result. The rhythm
of the poem is very pleasing, but it is, in a word, melodramatic.
Major Stanton's second and final collection of
his verse was <i>Jacob Brown and Other Poems</i> (Cincinnati,
1875). It contains several poems that are superior to
<i>The Moneyless Man</i>, but the general reader refuses to
read them. From 1875 till 1886 he edited the Frankfort
<i>Yeoman</i>; and during President Cleveland's first administration
he served as Land Commissioner. Besides his
poems, Major Stanton wrote a group of paper-backed
novels, entitled <i>The Kents; Social Fetters</i> (Washington,
1889); and <i>A Graduate of Paris</i> (Washington, 1890).
Major Stanton died at Frankfort, Kentucky, May 8,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
1898. Two years later <i>Poems of the Confederacy</i>
(Louisville, 1900), containing the war lyrics of the major,
was artistically printed as a memorial to his memory.
The introduction to the little book was written by Major
Stanton's friend and fellow man of letters, Colonel J.
Stoddard Johnston, and it is an altogether fitting remembrance
for the author of <i>The Moneyless Man</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="SARAH_M_B_PIATT" id="SARAH_M_B_PIATT">SARAH M. B. PIATT</a></h2>


<p>Mrs. Sarah Morgan Bryan Piatt, one of Kentucky's
most distinguished poets, was born near Lexington, Kentucky,
August 11, 1836. Her grandfather was Morgan
Bryan, brother-in-law of Daniel Boone, and one of the
proprietors of Bryan's Station, near Lexington, famous
in the old Indian wars. When only three years old she
left Lexington to make her home near Versailles, Kentucky,
where her beautiful mother died in 1844. After
her mother's death she was sent to her aunt's home at
New Castle, Kentucky. Miss Bryan was graduated from
Henry Female College, New Castle; and on June 18, 1861,
she was married to John James Piatt, the Ohio poet.
George D. Prentice, of course, was the first to praise and
print Mrs. Piatt's poems and start her upon a literary
career. Her husband, too, has been her chief critic, and
responsible for the publication of her work in book form.
From the first Mrs. Piatt's poems have been deeply introspective,
voicing the heart of a woman in every line. Her
work has been cordially commended by Bayard Taylor,
William Dean Howells, John Burroughs, Hamilton
Wright Mabie, and many other well-known and capable
critics in America and Europe. Several of Mrs. Piatt's
poems were published in <i>The Nests at Washington and
Other Poems</i> (Cincinnati, 1861), but her first independent
volume, issued anonymously, was <i>A Woman's Poems</i>
(Boston, 1871). This is her best known work, made
famous by Bayard Taylor in his delightful little book,
<i>The Echo Club</i>. This was followed by <i>A Voyage to the
Fortunate Isles and Other Poems</i> (1874); <i>That New
World and Other Poems</i> (1876); <i>Poems in Company with
Children</i> (1877); <i>Dramatic Persons and Moods</i> (1880);
<i>The Children Out of Doors and Other Poems</i> (with her
husband, 1885); <i>An Irish Garland</i> (1885); <i>Selected Poems</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
(1885); <i>In Primrose Time</i> (1886); <i>Child's-World Ballads</i>
(1887); <i>The Witch in the Glass</i> (1889); <i>An Irish Wild-Flower</i>
(1891); <i>An Enchanted Castle</i> (1893); <i>Complete
Poems</i> (1894, two vols.); <i>Child's-World Ballads</i> (1896,
second series); and <i>The Gift of Tears</i> (Cincinnati, 1906).
These volumes prove Mrs. Piatt to be one of the most prolific
and finest female poets America has produced. English
reviewers have often linked her name with Mrs.
Browning's and Miss Rossetti's, and if she has not actually
reached their rank, she has surely shown work worthy
of a high place in the literature of her native country. Mrs.
Piatt is at the present time residing at North Bend, Ohio,
near Cincinnati.</p>

<p>Boyd Winchester, author of a charming book on Switzerland,
was born in Ascension Parish, Louisiana, September
23, 1836. He came to Kentucky when a youth and
entered Centre College, Danville, where he studied for
three years. He subsequently spent two years at the
University of Virginia. Mr. Winchester was graduated
from the Law School of Louisville, Kentucky, in 1858, and
that city has been his home ever since. He rose rapidly
in his profession; and he later served a single term in the
Kentucky legislature, and two terms in the lower House
of Congress. President Cleveland appointed Mr. Winchester
United States Minister to Switzerland, in 1885,
and the next four years he resided at Berne. While in
Switzerland Mr. Winchester was an ardent student of the
country's history and a keen observer of its aspects and
institutions. On his return to the United States he wrote
his well-known book, <i>The Swiss Republic</i> (Philadelphia,
1891). A fire his publishers, the Lippincotts, suffered
shortly after his volume was issued, destroyed the unsold
copies, and the small first edition was soon exhausted.
The work has thus become exceedingly scarce.</p>

<p class="center">LAKE GENEVA<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p class="center">[From <i>The Swiss Republic</i> (Philadelphia, 1891)]</p>

<p>The Lake of Geneva is the largest of Western Europe, being
fifty-seven miles long, and its greatest width nine miles; it has its
storms, its waves, and its surge; now placid as a mirror, now
furious as the Atlantic; at times a deep-blue sea curling before
the gentle waves, then a turbid ocean dark with the mud and
sand from its lowest depths; the peasants on its banks still laugh
at the idea of there being sufficient cordage in the world to reach
the bottom of the <i>Genfer-See</i>. It is eleven hundred and fifty-four
feet above the sea, and having the same depth, its bottom
coincides with the sea-level; the water is of such exceeding purity
that when analyzed only 0.157 in 1000 contain foreign elements.
The lake lies nearly in the form of a crescent stretching from the
southwest towards the northeast. Mountains rise on every side,
groups of the Alps of Savoy, Valais, and Jura. The northern
or the Swiss shore is chiefly what is known as a <i>cote</i>, or a declivity
that admits of cultivation, with spots of verdant pasture scattered
at its feet and sometimes on its breast, with a cheery range of
garden, chalet, wood, and spire; villas, hamlets, and villages seem
to touch each other down by the banks, and to form but one
town, whilst higher up, they peep out from among the vineyards
or nestle under the shade of walnut-trees. At the foot of the
lake is the white city of Geneva, of which Bancroft wrote, "Had
their cause been lost, Alexander Hamilton would have retired
with his bride to Geneva, where nature and society were in their
greatest perfection." The city is divided into two parts by the
Rhone as it glides out of the basin of the lake on its course
towards the Mediterranean. The Arve pours its turbid stream
into the Rhone soon after that river issues from the lake. The
contrast between the two rivers is very striking, the one being as
pure and limpid as the other is foul and muddy. The Rhone
seems to scorn the alliance and keeps as long as possible unmingled
with his dirty spouse; two miles below the place of
their junction a difference and opposition between this ill-assorted
couple is still observable; these, however, gradually abate by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
long habit, till at last, yielding to necessity, and to the unrelenting
law which joined them together, they mix imperfect union
and flow in a common stream to the end of their course. At the
head of the lake begins the valley of the Rhone, where George
Eliot said, "that the very sunshine seemed dreary mid the desolation
of ruin and of waste in this long, marshy, squalid valley;
and yet, on either side of the weary valley are noble ranges of
granite mountains, and hill resorts of charm and health...."
Standing at almost any point on the Lake of Geneva, to the one
side towers Dent-du-Midi, calm, proud, and dazzling, like a queen
of brightness; on the other side is seen the Jura through her
misty shroud extending in mellow lines, and a cloudless sky vying
in depths of color with the azure waters. So graceful the outlines,
so varied the details, so imposing the framework in which
this lake is set, well might Voltaire exclaim, "Mon lac est le
premier," (my lake is the first). For richness combined with
grandeur, for softness around and impressiveness above, for a
correspondence of contours on which the eye reposes with unwearied
admiration, from the smiling aspect of fertility and cultivation
at its lower extremity to the sublimity of a savage nature
at its upper, no lake is superior to that of Geneva. Numberless
almost are the distinguished men and women who have lived,
labored, and died upon the shores of this fair lake; every spot has
a tale to tell of genius, or records some history. In the calm retirement
of Lausanne, Gibbon contemplated the decay of empires;
Rousseau and Byron found inspiration on these shores;
there is</p>

<h2><a name="THOMAS_M_GREEN" id="THOMAS_M_GREEN">THOMAS M. GREEN</a></h2>


<p>Thomas Marshall Green, journalist and historian, was
born near Danville, Kentucky, November 23, 1836, the
son of Judge John Green, an early Kentucky jurist of
repute, who died when his son was but two years old.
Green was graduated from Centre College, Danville, in
what is now known as the famous class of '55, which
included several men afterwards distinguished. In 1856
Green joined the staff of the <i>Frankfort Commonwealth</i>,
then a political journal of wide influence; and in the following
year he became editor of that paper. He left the
<i>Commonwealth</i> in 1860, to become editor of the <i>Maysville
Eagle</i>, of which he made a pronounced success, its
screams smacking not at all of the dignified days of its
first editors, the Collinses, father and son. His <i>Historic
Families of Kentucky</i> (Cincinnati, 1889), gave him a place
among Kentucky historians, but the late Colonel John
Mason Brown, of Louisville, gave to Green his greatest
opportunity when he published his <i>The Political Beginnings
of Kentucky</i> (Louisville, 1889). This work of Colonel
Brown's was, in effect, an avowed vindication of the
reputation of his grandfather, John Brown, first United
States Senator from Kentucky, who, in the stormy days
in which his lot had been cast, had been violently attacked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
for his alleged connection with the Spanish Conspiracy
of Aaron Burr, which was charged in a controversy running
through many years of violent disputation, to have
been an attempt in connection with General James Wilkinson,
Judges Sebastian, Wallace, and Innes of the Kentucky
Court of Appeals and others to detach Kentucky
from her allegiance to the United States, and annex her
territory to the Spanish dominions of the South and
South-west, through which the much-desired free navigation
of the Mississippi would be assured. Colonel Brown
was a brilliant man of unusual scholarly attainments and
deeply read in American history. These qualities with
his large legal training enabled him to present a strong
case in the vindication of his grandfather's reputation.
His arguments, theories, and proofs were illuminating,
able, and to many minds most convincing, while they fell
with small effect upon Green and many others who held
the opposite view. For this reason Green wrote and
published <i>The Spanish Conspiracy</i> (Cincinnati 1891), a
wonderfully well informed and clever work, and the one
upon which he takes his place among Western historians.
Students who would be fully informed as to the many
phases&mdash;the charges and matter relied upon for defense,
pro and con, in this bitter controversy which marshalled
Kentucky into two hostile camps, whose alignments were
more or less maintained through many strenuous years&mdash;must
study these two books. They present the last word
on either side. Colonel Brown's untimely death, which
occurred in 1890, some months before the appearance of
Green's book, probably lost Kentucky a reply to the Maysville
historian that would have added to the flood of light
thrown on this early and vital crisis. <i>The Spanish Conspiracy</i>
was supplemented and supported in its conclusions
by Mr. Anderson C. Quisenberry's <i>The Life and
Times of Hon. Humphrey Marshall</i> (Winchester, Kentucky,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
1892). Thomas M. Green died at Danville, Kentucky,
April 7, 1904.</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>The Spanish Conspiracy</i> (Cincinnati, 1891)]</p>

<p>The grief of the reader in learning from the <i>Political Beginnings</i>,
that Humphrey Marshall was "violent, irreligious and profane,"
will be mollified by the assurance given in the same work
that Harry Innes "was a sincerely religious man." It might
with equal truth have been stated that Caleb Wallace, who had
abandoned the Presbyterian pulpit to go into politics, kept up his
church relations, and practiced his devotions with the utmost
regularity. Sebastian also, who had cast off the gown of the
Episcopal ministry in his pursuit of the "flesh pots of Egypt,"
continued, it is believed, the exercise of all religious observations,
and, in the depth of his piety, deemed a treasonable overture entirely
too good to be communicated to an infidel. While John
Brown, who had absorbed faith as he sat under the very droppings
of the sanctuary, it will be cheerfully conceded was the
most devout of the four. On the other hand, John Wood, one
of the editors of the <i>Western World</i>, whom they afterwards
bought, was a reprobate; and young Joseph M. Street, whom
they could neither bribe nor intimidate, and the attempt to assassinate
whom proved a failure, was a sinner. It is distressing
to think that, like Gavin Hamilton, the latter "drank, and swore,
and played at cards." It may be that the wickedness of the
editors of the <i>Western World</i>, and the contemplation of their
own saintliness, justified in the eyes of the four Christian jurists
and statesmen the several little stratagems they devised, and
paid Littell for introducing into his "Narrative," in order to
obtain the advantage of the wicked editors in the argument. The
contrast of their characters made innocent those little mutilations
by Innes of his own letter to Randolph! The same process
of reasoning made laudable John Brown's suppression of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
Muter letter, his assertion that it was identical with the "sliding
letter," and his claim that the acceptance of Gardoqui's proposition
would have been consistent with the alleged purpose to make
some future application for the admission of Kentucky into the
new Union! While the suppression of the resolution of Wallace
and Wilkinson in the July convention, and the declaration that
such a <i>motion never was made</i>, in order to prove the unhappy
editors to be liars, became as praiseworthy as the spoiling of the
Egyptians by the Israelites! The scene of those four distinguished
gentlemen seated around a table, with a prayer-book in
the center, planning the screen for themselves and the discomfiture
of the editors, would be a subject worthy of the brush of
a Hogarth.</p>

<h2><a name="FORCEYTHE_WILLSON" id="FORCEYTHE_WILLSON">FORCEYTHE WILLSON</a></h2>


<p>Forceythe Willson, "the William Blake of Western
letters," was born at Little Genesee, New York, April
10, 1837, the elder brother of the latest Republican governor
of Kentucky, Augustus E. Willson. When Forceythe
was nine years old, his family packed their household
goods upon an "ark," or Kentucky flatboat, at Pittsburgh,
and drifted down the Ohio river, landing at Maysville,
Kentucky, where they resided for a year, and in
which town the future governor of Kentucky was born. In
1847 the Willsons removed to Covington, Kentucky, and
there Forceythe's education was begun. The family
lived at Covington for six years, at the end of which time
Forceythe entered Harvard University, but an attack of
tuberculosis compelled him to leave without his degree.
He returned to the West, making his home at New Albany,
Indiana, a little town just across the Ohio river
from Louisville. A year later Willson joined the editorial
staff of the <i>Louisville Journal</i>, and together he and
Prentice courted the muse and defended the cause of the
Union. Willson's masterpiece, <i>The Old Sergeant</i>, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
the "carrier's address" for January 1, 1863, printed
anonymously on the front page of the <i>Journal</i>. The
author's name was withheld until Dr. Oliver Wendell
Holmes pronounced it the best ballad the war had produced,
when Willson was heralded as its author. <i>The
Old Sergeant</i> recites an almost literally true story, and
it is wonderfully well done. In the fall of 1863 Willson
was married to the New Albany poet, Elizabeth C. Smith,
and they removed to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where
the future executive of the Commonwealth of Kentucky
was a student in Harvard University. The Willsons purchased
a home near Lowell's, and they were soon on
friendly terms with all of the famous New England writers.
In 1866 <i>The Old Sergeant and Other Poems</i> appeared
at Boston, but it did not make an appeal to the general
public. Forceythe Willson died at Alfred Centre, New
York, February 2, 1867, but his body was brought back
to Indiana, and buried on the banks of the Whitwater
river. Willson believed it quite possible for the living
to hold converse with the dead, and this, with other
strange beliefs, entered largely into his poetry.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Bibliography</span>. His authoritative biographer, Mr. John James
Piatt, the Ohio poet, has written illuminatingly of this rare fellow,
with his "almond-shaped eyes," as Dr. Holmes called
them, and his Oriental look and manner, in <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>
(March, 1875); <i>Lexington Leader</i> (September 13, 1908).
His brother, Hon. Augustus E. Willson, will shortly utter the
final word concerning him and his work.</p></blockquote>

<h2><a name="W_C_P_BRECKINRIDGE" id="W_C_P_BRECKINRIDGE">W. C. P. BRECKINRIDGE</a></h2>


<p>William Campbell Preston Breckinridge, orator and
journalist, was born at Baltimore, Maryland, August 28,
1837, the son of Rev. Robert J. Breckinridge (1800-1871),
and an own cousin of John C. Breckinridge (1821-1875).
He was graduated from Centre College, Danville, Kentucky,
in the famous class of '55, after which he studied
medicine for a year, when he abandoned it to enter the
Louisville Law School. Before he was of age he was
admitted to the Fayette County Bar, and he was a member
of it when he died. In July, 1862, he entered the Confederate
Army as a captain in John Hunt Morgan's command;
and during the last two years of the war was
colonel of the Ninth Kentucky Cavalry. The war over,
Colonel Breckinridge returned to Lexington and became
editor of <i>The Observer and Reporter</i>, which he relinquished
a few years later in order to devote his entire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
attention to the law. In 1884 Colonel Breckinridge was
elected to the lower House of Congress from the Ashland
district, and he took his seat in December, 1885, which
was the first session of the Forty-ninth Congress. One
of his colleagues from Kentucky was the present Governor
of the Commonwealth, James B. McCreary; another
was John G. Carlise, who was chosen speaker over Thomas
B. Reed of Maine. Colonel Breckinridge served ten
years in the House, closing his career there in the Fifty-third
Congress. In Washington he won a wide reputation
as a public speaker, being commonly characterized
as "the silver tongue orator from Kentucky." In 1894,
after the most bitter congressional campaign of recent
Kentucky history, he was defeated for re-election; and
two years later as the "sound money" candidate he again
met defeat, Evan E. Settle, who was also known in Congress
as a very eloquent orator, and who hailed from the
Kentucky county of "Sweet Owen," triumphing over
him. Colonel Breckinridge was never again a candidate
for public office. In 1897 he resumed his newspaper
work, becoming chief editorial writer on <i>The Lexington
Herald</i>, which paper was under the management of his
son, Mr. Desha Breckinridge, the present editor. During
the last eight years of his life Colonel Breckinridge
achieved a new and fresh fame as a writer of large information
upon State and national affairs. Simplicity
was the goal toward which he seemed to strive in his discussions
of great and small questions. His articles upon
the Goebel tragedy were really State papers of importance.
Upon more than one occasion his editorial utterances
were wired to a New York paper, appearing simultaneously
in that paper and in his own. He declined several
offers to become editor of metropolitan newspapers.
While at the present time Colonel Breckinridge is remembered
by the great common people as an orator of unsurpassed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
gifts, and while a great memorial mass of legends
have grown about his name, it is as a writer of real ability,
who had all the requisites and inclinations of a man of
letters save one of the chief essentials: leisure. When
his speeches and writings are collected and his biography
written his true position in the literature of Kentucky
will be more clearly and generally appreciated than it now
is. Colonel Breckinridge died at Lexington, Kentucky,
November 19, 1904.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Bibliography</span>. The eulogy of John Rowan Allen is the finest
summing up of Colonel Breckinridge's life and labors (<i>Lexington
Leader</i>, November 23, 1904); <i>Kentucky Eloquence</i>, edited
by Bennett H. Young (Louisville, Kentucky, 1907). His papers,
together with those of his grandfather and father, are now
in possession of the Library of Congress.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">"IS NOT THIS THE CARPENTER'S SON?"</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>The Lexington Herald</i> (Christmas Day, 1899)]</p>

<p>"And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by." And
this has been the universal truth since those days&mdash;the one
unchangeable, pregnant, vital truth of development, of progress,
of civilization, of happiness, of freedom, of charity. The perpetual
presence, the ceaseless personal influence, the potent force
of His continual association alone renders human history intelligible
or makes possible the solution of any grave problem which
man meets in his upward march to better life and more wholesome
conditions. And to-day the accepted anniversary of the
birth of the "carpenter's son" is the one day whose celebration
is in all civilized nations, among all independent people and in all
learned tongues. The world has not yet accepted Him; there
are nations very large in numbers, very old in histories, very
devout in their accepted religions, which have not accepted His
claim to be divine, nor bowed to the reign of His supreme authority.
And the contrast between such nations and those who
have accepted His claim and modeled their laws upon His teachings
form the profoundest reason for the verity of that claim
and the beneficence of those teachings.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p>Millions to-day will assemble themselves in their accustomed
houses of worship, and with songs and instruments of music,
with garlands and wreaths, with glad countenances and uplifted
hearts, render adoration to the carpenter's son of Nazareth;
adoration to the lowly Jew who was born in a manger and died
upon a cross. Many millions will not attend worship, but still
render unconscious testimony to the wondrous power which He
has exercised through the centuries in the glad happiness which
springs from conditions which are only possible under His teachings
and by the might of His perpetual presence. They will not
know that "Jesus of Nazareth passeth by," but the day is full
of joy, the homes are radiant with happiness, the cheer is jovial
and the laughter jocund, the eye brightens under the glances of
loved ones&mdash;because He has passed by and scattered love and
charity with profuse prodigality along the pathway He trod.</p>

<p>He has walked through the gay hearts of little children, and
joy has sprung up as wild flowers where His footsteps fell; He
has lingered at the mother's bedside and ineffable love has filled
the heart of her who felt His gentle presence. In carpenter
shops like unto that in which He toiled for thirty years, in humble
homes, in the counting rooms of bankers, in the offices of lawyers
and doctors, in the charitable institutions which are memorials of
His teachings, He has passed by; those within may not have been
conscious thereof; they were possibly too absorbed to feel the
sweet and pervading fragrance of the omnipotent force which He
always exerts; yet over them and their thoughts He did exert that
irresistible power; and to-day the world is better, sweeter, more
joyful, more loving, because of Him.</p>

<p>It is in its secular aspect that we venture to submit these
thoughts; it is His transforming power secularly to which we call
attention this sweet Christmas morning. "Christ the Lord Has
Risen," but it is Jesus the man&mdash;Jesus of Nazareth, the son of
the carpenter, the new teacher of universal brotherhood, the man
who went about doing good; the obscure Jew who brought the
new and nobler era of charity and forgiveness and love into
actual existence that <i>The Herald</i>, a mere secular paper, desires
to hold up.</p>

<p>And peculiarly to that aspect of His life that was social; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
friend of Lazarus; the diner at the table of Zaccheus; the pleased
and kindly guest at the wedding of Cana; the man who leaned
His head on the breast of His friend, the simple gentleman who
took little children in His arms and loved them; the obedient son,
the loyal friend, the forbearing associate, the forgiving master,
the tender healer of disease, the loving man who was touched
with a sense of all our infirmities.</p>

<p>To-day with jollity let us turn the water of our common lives
into the wine of sweet domestic happiness; let us take the children
of misfortune to our breast; let us be loyal to our weaker
friends; let us share our fullness with our brethren who are lean
in this world's goods, and, shedding smiles and kind words, and
pleasant phrases through the day, it may be that some stricken
heart made glad may say: "Jesus of Nazareth passeth by."</p>

<h2><a name="BASIL_W_DUKE" id="BASIL_W_DUKE">BASIL W. DUKE</a></h2>


<p>General Basil Wilson Duke, historian of Morgan's men,
was born near Georgetown, Kentucky, May 28, 1838. He
was educated at Georgetown and Centre Colleges, after
which he studied law at Transylvania University. He
was admitted to the bar, in 1858, and entered upon the
practice at St. Louis. In 1861 he was a member of the
Kentucky legislature; and in June of that year he married
the sister of John Hunt Morgan and enlisted in
Morgan's command. Upon Morgan's death, in 1864,
General Duke succeeded him as leader of the band. After
the war he settled at Louisville, Kentucky, as a lawyer,
and that city is his home today. From 1875 to 1880 General
Duke was commonwealth's attorney for the Fifth
Judicial District; and since 1895 he has been a commissioner
of Shiloh Military Park. His <i>Morgan's Cavalry</i>
(Cincinnati, 1867; New York, 1906), is the authoritative
biography of the noted partisan leader and history of his
intrepid band. General Duke was one of the editors of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
<i>The Southern Bivouac</i>, a Louisville magazine, from 1885
to 1887. His <i>History of the Bank of Kentucky</i> (Louisville,
1895), filled a gap in Kentucky history; and his
<i>Reminiscences</i> (New York, 1911), was a delightful volume
of enormous proportions.</p>

<p class="center">MORGAN, THE MAN</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>Morgan's Cavalry</i> (Cincinnati, 1867)]</p>

<p>General Morgan had more of those personal qualities which
make a man's friends devoted to him than any one I have ever
known. He was himself very warm and constant in the friendships
which he formed. It seemed impossible for him to do
enough for those to whom he was attached, or to ever give them
up. His manner, when he wished, prepossessed every one in his
favor. He was generally more courteous and attentive to his
inferiors than to his equals and superiors. This may have proceeded
in a great measure from his jealousy of dictation and impatience
of restraint, but was the result also of warm and generous
feeling. His greatest faults arose out of his kindness and
easiness of disposition, which rendered it impossible for him to
say or do unpleasant things, unless when under the influence of
strong prejudice or resentment. This temperament made him a
too lax disciplinarian, and caused him to be frequently imposed
upon. He was exceedingly and unfeignedly modest. For a long
time he sought, in every way, to avoid the applause and ovations
which met him everywhere in the South, and he never learned to
keep a bold countenance when receiving them.</p>

<p>His personal appearance and carriage were striking and graceful.
His features were eminently handsome and adapted to the
most pleasing expressions. His eyes were small, of a grayish
blue color, and their glances keen and thoughtful. His figure
on foot or on horseback was superb. He was exactly six feet in
height, and although not at all corpulent, weighed one hundred
and eighty-five pounds. His form was perfect and the rarest
combination of strength, activity, and grace. His constitution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
seemed impervious to the effects of privation and exposure, and
it was scarcely possible to perceive that he suffered from fatigue
or lack of sleep.</p>

<p>Men are not often born who can wield such an influence as he
exerted, apparently without an effort; who can so win men's
hearts and stir their blood. He will, at least, be remembered
until the Western cavalrymen and their children have all died.
The bold riders who lived in the border-land, whose every acre he
made historic, will leave many a story of his audacity and wily
skill.</p>

<h2><a name="HENRY_WATTERSON" id="HENRY_WATTERSON">HENRY WATTERSON</a></h2>


<p>Henry Watterson, the foremost Kentucky journalist, and
one of the most widely known newspaper men in the United
States, was born at Washington, D. C., February 16,
1840. This accident of birth was due to the fact that his
father, Harvey McGee Watterson, with his wife, was in
Washington as a member of the lower house of Congress
from his native state, Tennessee. In consequence of defective
vision, Henry Watterson was educated by private
tutors; but he did attend the Episcopal School at Philadelphia
for a short time. At the age of eighteen years he became
a reporter on the Washington <i>States</i>; but, in 1861, he
returned to Nashville, Tennessee, to edit the <i>Republican
Banner</i>. Watterson was a staff officer in the Confederate
Army, and in 1864 chief of scouts for General Joseph E.
Johnston, but throughout the war he was also editing a
newspaper. After the war he married and revived the
<i>Banner</i>, which he edited for about two years, when he
removed to Louisville, Kentucky, and succeeded George
D. Prentice as editor of the <i>Journal</i>. In the following
year Watterson, with Walter N. Haldeman, consolidated
the <i>Journal</i>, <i>Courier</i>, and <i>Daily Democrat</i> to form <i>The
Courier-Journal</i>. The first issue of this paper appeared
November 8, 1868, and Colonel Watterson has been its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
editor ever since. He has made it the greatest newspaper
in Kentucky, if not in the South or West, and one of the
best known papers printed in the English language. His
editorials are unequalled by any other writer in America,
either from the point of thought or construction; and his
style is always more interesting than his substance. Colonel
Watterson has held but one public office, having been
a member of the Forty-fourth Congress, in 1876, and the
personal friend and most ardent supporter of Samuel J.
Tilden in the infamous Hayes-Tilden controversy of that
year. Colonel Watterson has been a delegate-at-large
from Kentucky in many Democratic presidential conventions,
in all of which bodies he has been a conspicuous
figure. He is famous as a journalist, orator, and author.
His eulogy upon Abraham Lincoln has been listened to in
almost every state in the Union, and it is his best known
effort in oratory. Though now past his three score years
and ten, Colonel Watterson is as vigorous and vindictive
as ever in the handling of public questions and of his legion
of enemies, as the country witnessed in the presidential
campaign of 1912. He edited <i>Oddities of Southern
Life and Character</i> (Boston, 1882); and he has written
<i>The History of the Spanish-American War</i> (Louisville,
1898); <i>The Compromises of Life: Lectures and Addresses</i>
(New York, 1902), containing his ablest speeches delivered
upon many occasions; and <i>Old London Town</i> (Cedar Rapids,
Iowa, 1911), a group of his European letters to <i>The
Courier-Journal</i>, edited by Joseph Fort Newton. Colonel
Watterson has an attractive country home near Louisville,
"Mansfield," but in recent years his winters have been
spent at Naples-on-the-Gulf, in Florida, and his summers
in "grooming presidential candidates!"</p>

<p class="center">OLD LONDON TOWN<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p class="center">[From <i>Old London Town, and Other Travel Sketches</i> (Cedar Rapids, Iowa,
1910)]</p>

<p>London, less than any of the great capitals of the world&mdash;even
less than Berlin&mdash;has changed its aspects in the last four
decades of alteration and development. During the Second
Empire, and under the wizard hand of Baron Hauseman, a new
Paris sprang into existence. We know what has happened in
New York and Chicago. But London, except the Thames Embankment
and the opening of a street here and there betwixt the
City and the West End&mdash;the mid-London of Soho and the
Strand&mdash;is very much the London I became acquainted with
nearly forty years ago. To be sure many of the ancient landmarks,
such as Temple Bar, the Cock and the Cheshire Cheese,
have gone to the ash heap of the forgotten, whilst some imposing
hostelries have risen in the region about Trafalgar Square; but,
in the main, the biggest village of Christendom has lost none of
its familiar earmarks, so that the exile set down anywhere from
Charing Cross and Picadilly Circus to the bustling region of the
Old Lady of Threadneedle Street, blindfold, would, the instant
the bandage were removed from his eyes, exclaim, "It is London!"</p>

<p>Yes, it is London; the same old London; the same old cries in
the street; the same old whitey-brown atmosphere; even the same
old Italian organ-grinders, the tunes merely a trifle varied. Nor
yet without its charm, albeit to me of a rather ghostly, reminiscental sort. I came here in 1866, with a young wife and a roll of ambitious manuscript, found work to do and a publisher, lived for a time in the clouds of two worlds, that of Bohemia, of which the Savage Club was headquarters, and that of the New Apocalypse of Science which eddied about the School of Mines in
Jermyn Street and the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, then presided over by George Henry Lewes, my nearest friend and sponsor the late Professor Huxley. I alternated my days and nights between
a somewhat familiar intimacy with Spencer and Tyndall and a
wholly familiar intimacy with Tom Robertson and Andrew
Halliday. Artemus Ward was in London and it was to him that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
I owed these later associations. Sir Henry Irving had not made
his mark. Sir Charles Wyndham was still in America. There
were Keenes and Kembles yet upon the stage. Charles Matthews
ruled the roost of Comedy. George Eliot was in the glory of her
powers and her popularity. Thackeray was gone, but Charles
Dickens lived and wrote. Bulwer-Lytton lived and wrote.
Wilkie Collins and Charles Reade vied with one another for current
favor. Modern Frenchification had invaded neither the
restaurants nor the music halls. Evans's Coffee House (Pendennis
core of Harmony) prevailed after midnight in Covent Garden
Market. In short, the solidarities of Old England, along with
its roast, succulent, abundant and intact.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To me London was Mecca. The look of it, the very smell of it,
was inspiration. Incidentally&mdash;I don't mind saying&mdash;there
were some cakes and ale. The nights were jolly enough down in
the Adelphi, where the barbarians of the Savage Club held high
revel, and George Augustus Sala was Primate, and Edmund
Yates and Tom Robertson were High Priests. Temple Bar
blocked the passage from Belgravia to the Bank of England, and
there was no Holborn Viaduct nor Victorian Embankment.</p>

<p>Aye, long ago! How far away it seems, and how queer! To
me it was the London of story-books; of Whittington and his cat
and Goody Two-Shoes and the Canterbury Shades; of Otway and
Marlowe and Chatterton; of Nell Gwynne and Dick Steele and
poor Goldsmith; of all that was bizarre and fanciful in history,
that was strange and romantic in legend; and not the London of
the Tower, the Museum and Westminster Abbey; not the London
of Cremorne Gardens, newly opened, nor the Argyle Rooms,
which should have been burned to the ground before they were
opened at all.</p>

<p>Since then I have been in and out of London many times. I
have been amused here and bored here; but give me back my old
fool's paradise and I shall care for naught else.</p>

<p>One may doubt which holds him closest, the London of History
or the London of Fiction, or that London which is a mingling of
both, and may be called simply the London of Literature, in
which Oliver Goldsmith carouses with Tom Jones, and Harry
Fielding discusses philosophy with the Vicar of Wakefield, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
Nicholas Nickleby makes so bold as to present himself to Mr.
William Makepeace Thackeray and to ask his intercession in favor
of a poor artist, the son of a hairdresser of the name of Turner
in Maiden Lane, and even where "Boz," as he passes through
Longacre, is tripped up by the Artful Dodger, and would perchance
fall upon the siding if not caught in the friendly arms of
Sir Richard Steele on his way to pay a call upon the once famous
beauty, the Lady Beatrix Esmond.</p>

<p>But yesterday I strolled into Mitre Court, and threading my
way through the labyrinth of those dingy old law chambers
known as the Middle and Inner Temple, found myself in the little
graveyard of the Temple Church and by the side of the grave of
Oliver Goldsmith. Though less than a stone's throw from Fleet
Street and the Strand, the place is quiet enough, only a faint
hum of wheels penetrating the cool precincts and gloomy walls.
There, beneath three oblong slabs, put together like an outer
stone coffin, lies the most richly endowed of all the vagabonds,
with the simple but sufficient legend:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Here lies Oliver Goldsmith,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Born Nov. 10th, 1728. Died April 4th, 1774."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>to tell a story which for all its vagrancy and folly, is somewhat
dear to loving hearts. He died leaving many debts and a few
friends. He lived a lucky-go-devil, who could squander in a
night of debauch more than he could earn in a month of labor.
Yet he gave us the good Primrose and <i>The Deserted Village</i> and
<i>The Traveler</i>, and many a care-dispelling screed beside.</p>

<p>The Frenchman would say "his destiny." The less fanciful
Briton, "his temperament." Poor Noll! He seemed to know
himself fairly well in spite of his dissipations and his vanity, and
he sleeps sound enough now, perhaps as soundly as the rest of
those who in life held him in a rather equivocal admiration and
affectionate contempt. There are a few other tombs&mdash;an effigy
or two&mdash;round about, the weird old Chapel of the Templars,
shut in by great walls from the streets beyond, to keep them solemn
company. For Goldsmith, at least, there seems a fitness;
for his life, and such labor as he did, eddied round these sad precincts.
Nigh at hand was the Mitre tavern, across the way the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
Cock, and down the street the Cheshire Cheese. Without the
Vandal has been busy enough, within all remains as it was the
day they buried him. Perhaps he was not a desirable visiting
acquaintance. I dare say he was rather a trying familiar friend.
Pen-craft and purse-making are often wide apart. The charm of
authorship ends in most cases upon the printed page. The man
carries his sentiment in a globule of ink and it evaporates by exposure
to the atmosphere of the world of action. The song of
Dickens died by its own fireside. Kipling, for all his word-painting,
is hardly a miracle of grace. Why should one wish to have
known Goldsmith, or grudge him his place by the side of the
great old Doctor, and Burke, and Reynolds, and Garrick? He
lived his own life, and, though it was not very clean and wholly
unprosperous, perhaps he enjoyed it. He left us some rich fruitage
dangling over a wall, which may well conceal all else. Of
the dead, no ill! Their faults to the past. The rest to Eternity!</p>

<p>Gradually, but surely, a new London is showing itself above the
debris of the old. Miles of roundabout are reduced by short cuts.
Thoroughfares are ruthlessly cut through sacred precincts and
landmarks obliterated to make room for imposing edifices and
widened streets. In the end, London will be rebuilt to rival Paris
in the splendor, without the uniformity of its architecture. The
grime will, of course, attach itself in time to the modern city as
it did in the ancient, so that the London that is to be will grow
old to the coming generations as the London that was grew old to
the generations that went before.</p>

<p>Ever and ever the old times, the dear old times! Were they

<p>Somehow, London has a tendency to call up such reflections;
sombre, serious itself, to provoke moralizing, albeit a turmoil,

<h2><a name="GILDEROY_W_GRIFFIN" id="GILDEROY_W_GRIFFIN">GILDEROY W. GRIFFIN</a></h2>


<p>Gilderoy Wells Griffin, essayist, was born at Louisville,
Kentucky, March 6, 1840, the son of a merchant. He was
educated in the University of Louisville, and admitted to
the bar just as he attained his majority. He soon became
private secretary for George D. Prentice, and this pointed
his path from law to letters. Griffin was dramatic critic
of the Louisville <i>Journal</i> until after Prentice's death; and
his first book was a biographical study of the great editor.
His <i>Studies in Literature</i> (Baltimore, 1870), a small group
of essays, was followed by the final edition of <i>Prenticeana</i>
(Philadelphia, 1871), which he revised and to which he
also contributed a new sketch of Prentice. Griffin was
appointed United States Consul to Copenhagen, in 1871.
His <i>Memoir of Col. Charles S. Todd</i> (Philadelphia, 1872),
was an excellent piece of writing. The most tangible
result of his sojourn in Copenhagen was <i>My Danish
Days</i> (1875), one of the most delightful of his
works. In Denmark his most intimate friend, perhaps,
was Hans Christian Anderson. His <i>A Visit to Stratford</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
(1875), was worth while. The year following its publication,
Griffin was transferred to a similar position in the Samoan
Islands, and he left in manuscript a work on the Islands
which has never been published. In 1879 Griffin was
again transferred, this time being sent to Aukland, New
Zealand, where he remained until 1884; and the time of his
departure witnessed the appearance of his last work, <i>New
Zealand: Her Commerce and Resources</i> (Wellington, N.
Z., 1884). President Arthur sent him as consul to Sydney,
which post he held for seven years. Griffin's death
occurred while he was visiting his old home, Louisville,
Kentucky, October 21, 1891. His brother was the step-father
of the famous Mary Anderson, the former actress,
and she has a goodly word for the memory of Griffin in
her autobiography. He was a patron of the drama, a
faithful and far-seeing diplomat, and a very able writer.
His wife, Alice M. Griffin, published a volume of <i>Poems</i>
(Cincinnati, 1864).</p>

<p class="center">THE GYPSIES</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>Studies in Literature</i> (Baltimore, 1870)]</p>

<p>The Gypsies are wholly ignorant of their origin, and have kept
but an imperfect record of their migrations; but it is evident that
they are a distinct race of people. Like the Jews, they have no
country of their own, and are scattered over all parts of the
globe. Time has made little or no change in their peculiarities.
They have the same language, personal appearance, habits, and
customs, that they had centuries ago. The name of Gypsies
(meaning Egyptians) is doubtless an incorrect one. At least we
know of nothing to justify them in the assumption of the title.
In Italy they are called "Zingari," in Germany "Zigeuner," in
Spain "Gitanos," in Turkey "Tchengenler," in Persia "Sisech
Hindu," in Sweden "Tartars," and in France "Bohemiens."</p>

<p>Borrow expresses the opinion that the name of Gypsies originated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
among the priests and learned men of Europe, who expected
to find in Scripture some account of their origin and some
clew to their skill in the occult sciences.</p>

<p>Simson, the author of a recent work entitled the <i>History of the
Gypsies</i>, believes that they are a mixture of the shepherd-kings
and the native Egyptians, who formed part of the "mixed multitude"
mentioned in the Biblical account of the expulsion of the
Jews from Egypt. Grellman, however, traces their origin to
India. He says that they belong to the Soodra caste. Vulcanius
describes them simply as robbers and outlaws, and Hervas regards
their language as "a mere jargon of banditti."</p>

<p>Their keen black eyes, swarthy complexion, long raven locks,
high cheek-bones, and projecting lower jaws evidently indicate
Asiatic origin. It is certain that neither their language nor
physiognomy are African. It is argued that if really Egyptians,
they would in all probability have preserved a religion, or some
of the forms of worship so characteristic of the descendants of
that people; whereas, the Gypsies have no religion at all.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is a proverb with them that "the Gypsy church was
built of lard, and the dogs ate it."</p>

<p>Whether Egyptians or not, they are doubtless what they claim
to be, "Rommany Chals," and not "Gorgios." Very few who
have seen them will refuse to believe that they do not understand
the art of making horse-shoes, and of snake-charming, fortunetelling,
poisoning with the drows, and of singing such songs as
the following:</p>

<p>John Lancaster Spalding, the poet-priest, was born at
Lebanon, Kentucky, June 2, 1840. He is a nephew of
Archbishop Martin John Spalding. John L. Spalding
was graduated from St. Mary's College, Maryland, in
1859; and a short time later he was ordained as a priest
in the Roman Catholic church. In 1865 he was secretary
to the bishop of Louisville; and four years later he built
St. Augustine's church for the Catholic negroes of Louisville.
In 1871 Spalding was chancellor of the diocese of
Louisville. From 1872 to 1877 he was stationed in New
York City. He was consecrated bishop of Peoria, Illinois,
May 1, 1877, which position he held until 1908, when
ill-health compelled his retirement. Bishop Spalding
was appointed by President Roosevelt as one of the arbitrators
to settle the anthracite coal strike of 1902, and this
appointment brought him before the whole country for a
time. In 1909 he was created titular archbishop of
Scyphopolis. Bishop Spalding continues his residence at
Peoria, but recently his health has broken so badly that
his life has been despaired of more than once. For many
years it has been his custom to spend his summers in Kentucky
with his boyhood friends and neighbors. He is the
author of <i>The Life of the Most Rev. Martin John Spalding,
Archbishop</i> (New York, 1872); <i>Essays and Reviews</i>
(1876); <i>Religious Mission of the Irish People</i> (1880);

biography of his famous kinsman, Archbishop Spalding,
is his finest prose work, and as a poet he has done some
pleasing verse, most of which, of course, is marred by being
woven into his religion.</p>

<h2><a name="NATHANIEL_S_SHALER" id="NATHANIEL_S_SHALER">NATHANIEL S. SHALER</a></h2>


<p>Nathaniel Southgate Shaler, the distinguished Harvard
geologist, poet, historian, and sociologist, was born at
Newport, Kentucky, February 20, 1841. He was graduated
from Harvard in 1862, where he had the benefit
of almost private instruction from the great Agassiz.
Shaler returned to Kentucky, and for the next two years
he served in the Union army. In 1864 he was appointed
assistant in palentology at Harvard; and four years later
he became assistant in zoology and geology in the Lawrence
Scientific School and head of the department of
palentology. In 1873 the Governor of Kentucky appointed
Professor Shaler director of the Kentucky Geological
Survey, and he devoted parts of the next seven years to
this work. He was the most efficient State geologist Kentucky
has ever known, and his work for the Survey pointed
out the path trodden by his successors. His assistant,
Professor John R. Proctor, followed him as Director, and
he stands next to his chief in the work he accomplished.
<i>The Kentucky Geological Survey</i> (1874-1880, 6 vols.), volume
three of which, entitled <i>A General Account of the
Commonwealth of Kentucky</i> (Cambridge, Mass., 1876),
was written entirely by Shaler, are excellent memorials
of the work he did for his native state. In 1884 Shaler
was placed in charge of the Atlantic division of the United
States Geological Survey; and in 1891 he was chosen dean
of the Lawrence Scientific School at Harvard. This position
he held until a year or two before his death. Dean
Shaler published <i>Thoughts on the Nature of Intellectual
Property</i> (Boston, 1878); <i>Glaciers</i> (Boston, 1881); <i>The
First Book of Geology</i> (Boston, 1884); <i>Kentucky: A
Pioneer Commonwealth</i> (Boston, 1885), the philosophy
of Kentucky history summarized; <i>Aspects of the Earth</i>
(New York, 1889); <i>Nature and Man in America</i> (New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>

<i>Sea and Land</i> (New York, 1892); <i>The United States</i> (New
York, 1893); <i>The Interpretation of Nature</i> (Boston,
1893); <i>Domesticated Animals</i> (New York, 1895); <i>American
Highways</i> (New York, 1896); <i>Outlines of the Earth's
History</i> (New York, 1898); <i>The Individual</i> (New York,
1900); <i>Elizabeth of England</i> (Boston, 1903, five vols.), a
"dramatic romance," celebrating "the spacious times of
great Elizabeth"; <i>The Neighbor</i> (Boston, 1904); <i>The Citizen</i>
(New York, 1904); <i>Man and the Earth</i> (New York,
1905); and <i>From Old Fields</i> (Boston, 1906), a book of
short poems. Besides these books, Dean Shaler wrote
hundreds of magazine articles, reports, scientific memoirs,
miscellaneous essays. He died at Cambridge, Massachusetts,
April 10, 1906, just as he was about to make ready
for a final journey to Kentucky. Dean Shaler was loved
and honored more at Harvard, perhaps, than any other
teacher the University has ever known.</p>

<p class="center">"TOM" MARSHALL<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p class="center">[From <i>The Autobiography of Nathaniel Southgate Shaler</i> (Boston, 1909)]</p>

<p>I have referred above to Thomas F. Marshall, a man of singular
attractiveness and talents with whom I had a curious relation.
I first met him when I was about fourteen years of age, when he,
for some time a congressman, had through drunkenness fallen
into a curious half-abandoned mode of life. He was then an
oldish fellow, but retained much of his youthful splendor. He
was about six feet three inches high, but so well built that he did
not seem large, until you stood beside him. His face, even when
marred by drink, had something of majesty in it. Marshall,
when I knew him, picked up a scanty living as a lecturer. When
sober, which he often was for months at a time, his favorite subject
was temperance. On this theme he was as eloquent as
Gough; in his season of spree, he turned to history. The gradations
were not sharp, for he would, as I have seen him, preach
most admirably of the evil of drink while he supported himself
in his fervent oratory with whiskey from a silver mug. In matters
of history, he had read widely. One of his favorite themes
was the medival history of Italy. I recall with a distinctness
which shows the impressiveness of his discourses his story of
Florence, so well told that ten years after, when I saw the town
for the first time, the shape of it and of the neighboring places
was curiously familiar. Along with some other youths, I noted
down the dates of events as he gave them and looked them up.
We never caught him in an error, though at times he was so
drunk that he could hardly stand up. I have known many historians
who doubtless much exceeded him in learning, but never
another who seemed to have such a capacity for living in the
events he narrated.</p>

<p>I had no sooner met "Tom" Marshall than we became friends.
He at once took a curious fancy to me, talked to me as though we
were of an age, and gave me my first chance of such contact with
a man of learning and imagination. The relation, while on one
side largely profitable to me, became embarrassing, for the unhappy
man got the notion that I could stop his drinking if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
would stay with him. A number of times when he had his dipsomaniac
fury upon him I found that by sitting by his bed and
talking with him on some historical subject, or rather listening to
his talk, he would apparently forget about his drink and in a few
hours drop asleep and awake to be sober for some months.</p>

<p>Sometimes these quiet interviews were most interesting to me.
I recall one of them when I found him in an attack of half delirium.
His memory, always active, took him back to the days
when he was in Congress and to the scene when he, a very young
member of the House, had been chosen by some careful elders to
lead an attack on John Quincy Adams. They, the elders, were
to come to his support when he had drawn the enemy's fire. It
all became so real to him, that he sprang out of bed and in his
tattered nightgown gave, first his own speech with all the actions
of a young orator, and then the deliberate, crushing rejoinder of
his mighty antagonist. At the end of it he fell back upon his
bed, cursing the villains who led him into the fight and left him
to take the consequences.</p>

<p>My relations with Marshall continued until I went to Cambridge
but my influence over his drinking gradually lessened as
he sank lower, and his able mind began to be permanently clouded.
When I had been some months at college, I espied the poor
fellow in the street, carpet-bag in hand, evidently making for my
quarters. I sent word by a messenger to my chum, Hyatt, to
receive and care for him, but to say that I had left town, which
was true, for I went at once to Greenfield, where I had friends.
Hyatt was also to provide the wanderer with a suit of clothes and
a railway ticket back to Kentucky. I stayed away until I learned
that Marshall was on his way home. I have always been ashamed
of my conduct in this matter, but the unhappy man was at that
time of his degradation an impossible burthen for me to carry;
once ensconced in my quarters it would have been impossible to
provide him with a dignified exit, and there was no longer hope
that I might reform him. Yet the cowardice of the action has
grieved me to this day.</p>

<p>Two years afterwards, in 1862, I saw Marshall for the last
time. I was with a column of troops going through the town of
Versailles, Kentucky. He was seated in front of a bar-room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
with his chin upon the top of his cane. He was so far gone that
the sight merely troubled his wits without affording him any explanation
of what it meant. His bleared though still noble face
stays in my memories as one of the saddest of those weary years.</p>


<p class="center">LINCOLN IN KENTUCKY</p>

<p class="center">[From the same]</p>

<p>Among the interesting and in a way shaping incidents of my
boyhood, was a brief contact with Abraham Lincoln about 1856.
He was coming on foot from the town of Covington; I was on
horseback, and met him near the bridge over the Licking River.
He asked the way to my grandfather's house, which was about a
mile off. Attracted by his appearance, I dismounted and asked
him to get on my horse, which he declined to do; so I walked
beside him. Probably because he knew how to talk to a lad&mdash;few
know the art, and those the large natures alone&mdash;we became
at once friendly. When I had shown him into the house, I hung
about to find his name. As I had never heard of Mr. Lincoln of
Illinois, it was explained to me that he was the man who was
"running against" the Little Giant. We lads all knew Stephen
A. Douglas, who was so popular that farm tools were named for
him: the Little Giant this and that of cornshellers or ploughs.
While Mr. Lincoln was with my grandfather, my mother dined or
supped with him. When she came home she said: "I have had
a long talk with Mr. Lincoln, who is called an Abolitionist; if he
is an Abolitionist, I am an Abolitionist." I well remember the
horror with which this remark inspired the household: if my
mother had said she was Satan, it could not have been worse.
The droll part of the matter is that all the reasonable people
about me were in heart haters of slavery. They saw and deplored
its evils, and were full of fanciful schemes for making an
end of it. But the name Abolitionist was abominated.</p>

<p>I never knew what brought Mr. Lincoln to my grandfather's
house. It is likely that he came because a certain doctor of central
Kentucky, an uncle of Mr. Lincoln, a widower, had recently
married an aunt of mine, a widow. This union of two middle-aged
people, each with large families, brought trouble; since
family traditions were against divorce, a separation was effected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
which had an amusing though tragic finish. When all other
matters of property had been arranged and P. had betaken himself
to his plantation in Mississippi, as an afterthought he set up
a supplementary claim to a saddle mule belonging to my aunt
which he had forgotten to demand in the settlement. This reopened
the question, and it was determined in family council that
the grasping doctor should not be satisfied. We boys had the
notion that Mr. Lincoln's visit related to this episode of the mule,
for shortly after the "critter" was sent with a servant by steamboat,
to be delivered to the claimant at the landing of his plantation
on the Mississippi River. In due time the negro returned
and made report: It was that the unworthy suitor came with a
group of his friends to witness his success, mounted, and started
to ride away, but the beast, frisky from its long confinement,
"stooped up behind," as the darkeys phrase it, and threw his
master and killed him. Whether Lincoln had a hand in the negotiations
which led to this finish or not, I am sure that the humor
of it must have tickled him.</p>

<h2><a name="WILLIAM_L_VISSCHER" id="WILLIAM_L_VISSCHER">WILLIAM L. VISSCHER</a></h2>


<p>William Lightfoot Visscher, poet, was born at Owingsville,
Kentucky, November 25, 1842. He was educated
at the Bath Seminary, Owingsville, and graduated in
law from the University of Louisville, but he never practiced.
He was a soldier in the Civil War for four years.
Colonel Visscher&mdash;which title he did not win upon the
battlefield!&mdash;has been connected with more newspapers
than he now cares to count; and he has written hundreds
of verses which have appeared in periodicals and in book
form. He is the author of five novels: <i>Carlisle of Colorado</i>;
<i>Way Out Yonder</i>; <i>Thou Art Peter</i>; <i>Fetch Over the
Canoe</i> (Chicago, 1908); and <i>Amos Hudson's Motto</i>. The
first of these is the best known work he has done in prose
fiction. His <i>Thrilling and Truthful History of the Pony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
Express</i> (Chicago, 1908), filled a small gap in American
history. A little group of biographical sketches and newspaper
reminiscences, called <i>Ten Wise Men and Some More</i>
(Chicago, 1909), is interesting. Colonel Visscher has also
published five books of verse: <i>Black Mammy; Harp of the
South; Blue Grass Ballads and Other Verse</i> (Chicago,
1900); <i>Chicago: an Epic</i>, and his most recent volume,
<i>Poems of the South and Other Verses</i> (Chicago, 1911).
The colonel is also a popular lecturer; and he has actually
put paint on his face and essayed acting. He is a poet of
the Old South, one reading his verse would at once conclude
that not to have been born in Kentucky before the
war, one might as well never have lived at all. He is a
versified, pocket-edition of Mr. Thomas Nelson Page;
and while he has not reached the sublime heights of true
poesy, he has written some delicious dialect and much
pleasing verse. <i>Proem</i>, printed in two of his books, is
certainly the best thing he has done hitherto.</p>

<p>Bennett Henderson Young, historian and antiquarian,
was born at Nicholasville, Kentucky, May 25, 1843, the son
of blue-stocking Presbyterians. His academic training
was received at Centre College, Danville, Kentucky, and
Queen's College, Toronto, Canada. He was graduated
in law from Queen's College, Belfast, Ireland. Colonel
Young was with General John Hunt Morgan and his
men during the Civil War, being in charge of the raid
through St. Alban's, Vermont. He was a member of the
fourth Constitutional convention which formulated Kentucky's
present constitution. Colonel Young is now one of
the leading lawyers of Louisville, and commander-in-chief
of the United Confederate Veterans. He has published <i>The
History of the Kentucky Constitutions</i> (1890); <i>The History
of Evangelistic Work in Kentucky</i> (1891); <i>History
of the Battle of the Blue Licks</i> (Louisville, 1897); <i>The History
of Jessamine County, Kentucky</i> (Louisville, 1898);

Young has taken a keen interest in "the prehistoric men of
Kentucky," the mound-builders; and his collection is one

It represented the researches of a life-time, and the results
of his labors are quite obvious.</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>The Prehistoric Men of Kentucky</i> (Louisville, Kentucky, 1910)]</p>

<p>The life of prehistoric man, judging from the large number
of fortifications existing in Kentucky to this day, must have been
one of constant and general warfare. His weapons were all constructed
for conflict at short range.</p>

<p>First was his ax of two kinds, grooved and grooveless. The
indications are that these were used contemporaneously, and
though this is not certain, their proximity to each other in so
many places would tend to show that they were made during the
same period. The grooved ax would be more reliable either in
domestic use or in war than the grooveless ax, because of the grip
of the handle, aided materially by the groove, permitting it to be
held much more closely and to admit of heavier strokes and more
constant action. The battle-axes vary in weight from one to
thirty-two pounds. They were doubtless so variant in weight
by reason of the conditions that surrounded the makers, and also
by reason of the ability of the user to carry either light or heavy
weight. With handles from three to six feet and firmly bound with
rawhide, which could be obtained from several animals, these men
were enabled to fasten the handle tightly around the ax, either
grooved or ungrooved. These axes would require close contact
in battle. They had flint saws or knives which enabled them to
cut the hickory withe or sapling from which these handles were
made. After soaking the handle in hot water, or for that matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
in cold water, it could easily have been bent around the ax and
tied with rawhide, which, by its contraction when drying, would
press the handle closely in the groove.</p>

<p>They also used what is known as a battle-ax blade, that is, a
thin piece of flint, oval in shape, about five by three and a half
inches. By splitting the handle and placing the flint blade between
it, and then binding with rawhide, they were enabled to
fasten it very securely. These handles were about two or two
and a half feet in length, and with the blade projecting on either
side, became a dangerous weapon at close range.</p>

<p>The most damage, however, done by these prehistoric people
was doubtless accomplished by the bow and arrow. The bows
were about six feet in length, judging by the strings which we
have seen and one of which the writer has been able to secure
from Salts Cave. They would be made of many woods, preferably
of hickory, cedar, or ash, but hickory usually possesses
greater strength than other timbers of similar size. It is not
probable that they had any tools with which they could split the
hickory trees. They would, therefore, be compelled to use the
hickory saplings in the manufacture of bow staves.</p>

<p>The penetrative force of the stone-tipped arrow, driven by the
strong and skillful arms of these prehistoric men, must have been
very great. Quite a number of instances are known and specimens
preserved in which they were driven practically through
the larger bones of the body. The author has a human pelvis
found in a cave in Meade County. Imbedded in this is a portion
of a flint arrow-point, the position of which shows that it had
been driven through the body, penetrating the bone on the opposite
side from which it entered. The point reached into the
socket of the hip joint. There it remained, causing necrosis of
the bone, until by processes of Nature the wastage was stopped,
and the point remained in the bone until the death of the individual,
which the indications show occurred long after receiving
the wound. In one instance an arrowhead was driven three
inches into the bone of the leg just below its union with the hip,
and evidently caused the death of the party into whom it had
been shot. A number of instances are known in which these arrowheads
penetrated several inches into bone, and it was no unusual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
thing that they attained sufficient penetrative force to
drive them through both coverings of the skull.</p>

<p>Three of these arrowheads that have come under the immediate
observation of the author are not sharp at all, but rather blunt.
The smaller triangular arrowheads, if sufficiently strong&mdash;and
probably they were&mdash;could have been driven readily into bone
without the use of any great force, but an arrow-point about
three inches in length, and with a blunt point, thus driven into
the bones of the body, demonstrates beyond all question that the
power which was used in their propulsion must have been comparatively very great.</p>

<p>The wooden or cane shafts probably were tipped with many
kinds of points, some beveled, some serrated, some triangular,
some blunt, being fastened thereto with the sinew of the deer or
other animal. There are some evidences, although not entirely
conclusive, that these arrow-points were often tipped with poison. It is said that at one time the Shawnees in Western Kentucky were so well versed in the use of poisons that they could place them in springs and thus destroy their enemies, and also that quite large streams of water were impregnated with these dangerous elements. We sometimes comment upon the savageness of the methods of these people, but the poisoned arrow is no worse than the soft-nose or explosive bullet, which has been used by civilized nations in the memory of living people.</p>

<p>The next weapon was the spear. These carried points so large
that they could not have been used with the ordinary bow. They
must have been attached to a larger piece of wood or cane than
the arrow-shaft. They were probably mounted upon cane or pieces of wood from four and one-half to seven feet in length.
They were doubtless used also in the destruction of the larger animals, either bears or buffaloes, during the buffalo period in Kentucky. The spear would be much more formidable in close quarters with an animal even as large as the wildcat than the bow
and arrow. It would be comparatively as efficient as the bayonet
of modern times.</p>

<p>Many of the flint knives were mounted on wooden handles.
These sometimes measure from one to ten inches in length, and
at very close range would become formidable weapons&mdash;not as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
formidable, however, as the battle-ax blade which has been described
above.</p>

<p>In Kentucky there are no evidences of the cross-bow having
been used. The five weapons which we have described completed
the military accoutrement of these men, who must have
spent a large portion of their lives in warlike scenes and exploits.</p>

<h2><a name="JAMES_H_MULLIGAN" id="JAMES_H_MULLIGAN">JAMES H. MULLIGAN</a></h2>


<p>James Hilary Mulligan, the author of <i>In Kentucky</i>, was
born at Lexington, Kentucky, November 21, 1844. He
was graduated at St. Mary's College, Montreal, Canada,
in 1864; and five years later Kentucky (Transylvania)
University granted him his degree in law. For forty
years Judge Mulligan has been known in Kentucky as a
lawyer, orator, and maker of clever, humorous verse.
He was editor of the old Lexington <i>Morning Transcript</i>
for a year; and for six years he was judge of the Recorder's
Court of Lexington, from which work he won
his title of "judge." From 1881 to 1888 Judge Mulligan
was a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives;
and from 1890 to 1894 he was in the State Senate.
In 1894 President Cleveland appointed Judge Mulligan
Consul-General at Samoa, and this post he held for two
years. While in Samoa he saw much of Robert Louis
Stevenson, who was working upon <i>Weir of Hermiston</i>,
and well upon his way to the undiscovered country when
the Kentucky diplomat met him. When Stevenson died,
December 4, 1894, the first authoritative news of his passing
came in a now rare and precious little booklet of thirty-seven
pages which Lloyd Osbourne, Judge Mulligan,
Bazett Haggard, brother of the English novelist, and another
writer, sent out to the world, entitled <i>A Letter to
Mr. Stevenson's Friends</i> (Apia, Samoa, 1894). It contained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
a detailed account of the writer's last days, his
death, and funeral. Mr. Osbourne "ventured also to reprint
Mr. Gosse's beautiful lines, <i>To Tusitala in Vailima</i>,
which reached Mr. Stevenson but three days before his
death." President Cleveland offered to send Judge Mulligan
to Cape Town, Africa, but he declined the appointment,
and came home. For the past fifteen years he has devoted
his attention to the law and to the writing of verse
and prose. His <i>Samoa, the Government, Commerce, and
People</i> (Washington, 1896), is said to be the most exhaustive
account of that island ever published. Judge Mulligan's
little humorous poem, <i>In Kentucky</i>, has made him
famous. First read at a banquet in the old Phoenix Hotel,
Lexington, in 1902, it has been declaimed in the halls of
Congress and gotten into the <i>Congressional Record</i>. It
has been parodied a thousand times, reproduced in almost
every newspaper in English, illustrated, and at least one
Kentuckian has heard it chanted by an Englishman in the
shadow of the Pyramids in Egypt! More than a million
souvenir postal cards have been sold with the verses
printed upon them; and had the author had <i>In Kentucky</i>
copyrighted, he would have reaped a harvest of golden
coins. As poetry Judge Mulligan's <i>Over the Hills to
Hustonville</i>, or <i>The Bells of Old St. Joseph's</i>, are superior
to <i>In Kentucky</i>, but they are both comparatively unknown
to the general public. Judge Mulligan's home,
"Maxwell Place," on the outskirts of Lexington, was the
birthplace of <i>In Kentucky</i>.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nelly (Nichol) Marshall McAfee, novelist and
verse writer, was born at Louisville, Kentucky, May 8,
1845, the daughter of Humphrey Marshall, the younger.
When but eighteen years of age she embarked upon a literary
career. Her verse and short-stories appeared
in many of the best American newspapers and magazines,
and they brought her a wide reputation. On
February 13, 1871, after a romantic courtship of some
years, Miss Marshall was married to Captain John J.
McAfee, a former Confederate soldier, then a member
of the Kentucky legislature. Mrs. McAfee published two
volumes of verse, entitled <i>A Bunch of Violets</i>, and <i>Leaves
From the Book of My Heart</i>. Her novels include <i>Eleanor
Morton, or Life in Dixie</i> (New York, 1865); <i>Sodom
Apples</i> (1866); <i>Fireside Gleamings</i> (Chicago, 1866); <i>Dead
Under the Roses</i> (1867); <i>Wearing the Cross</i> (Cincinnati,

<p class="center">FINALE</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>A Criminal Through Love</i> (Louisville, Kentucky, 1882)]</p>

<p>Many years have been gathered to the illimitable past, and we
find ourselves, with undiminished interest, seeking to learn all
we can in regard to the positions and attainments of the characters
who have been with us for so long.</p>

<p>This is the gist of what we have learned about them.</p>

<p>Walter Floor's firm has grown and flourished; the dark cloud
of sorrow that so long overshadowed his sky, has rolled away,
and he is nevermore melancholy or oppressed. His home is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
resting-place and haven for everybody who chooses to enjoy
shelter and repose. Constant and Valentine are standing guests
at the Floor mansion; the talented painter has no longer any
need to work for money. The mention of his name opens every
door to him, and Fortune and Fame await him with their arms
laden with golden sheaves and shining laurel wreaths. His
greatest work of art&mdash;his masterpiece&mdash;was taken from Mozart's
Opera of <i>Don Juan</i>. At a glance any one could tell that
the artist painted the portrait <i>con amore</i>, for Donna Anna was
nothing more than a portrait of Margarethe Heinold&mdash;whom
we must ever after this moment remember only as Margarethe
Hendrik. More happiness than came with this name to her could
scarcely be enjoyed by mortal. Great sums were offered again
and again to Constant for this picture, but he refused to sell it;
it now graces the elegant <i>Salon</i> of Julian Hendrik in his magnificent
villa, which stands on the banks of the Rhine.</p>

<p>Margarethe, after the night of her brilliant <i>debut</i>, never
stepped upon the boards. She was often urged to let the world
hear her splendid voice, which returned to her in all its volume
and beauty after she regained her health, but she refused to entertain
the proposition for an instant, declaring that public life,
however glorious, had no charms for her; that she lived only for
her husband, to whom she becomes ever more tenderly attached
the better she became acquainted with his noble heart, elevated
mind, and peerless character as a man and a gentleman.</p>

<p>Didier Mametin is still in Paris; at the death of old Vincent he
became his heir, and was at last able to open such a photographer's
<i>Atelier</i> as other artists pronounced perfect in every detail.
The lighthearted Frenchman, never accustomed to an extravagant
mode of living, is just as merry in humor and abstemious
in diet as of yore. Henriette often declares that he acts as if
he were afraid of starving&mdash;he is such a hoarder for "rainy
days." But Didier had a varied experience, and the lessons he
learned were not easily forgotten. One happy fact remains:
He and Henriette love each other dearly, and would not exchange
their places or give up their home to be a king and queen
and live in a palace.</p>

<p>Roderick Martens attends to the ship-building interests of Jyphoven,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
in Amsterdam, and occupies the old Jyphoven mansion.
Herr and Madame Jyphoven continue to reside in Paris. Bella
is enchanted with life in the French city, and declares that to be
mistress of the whole world&mdash;if she would go but for a day&mdash;could
be no inducement to her to set her foot in the old Holland
fishery, as she now describes it to be. She is entirely reconciled
to Francisca. The beauty and happiness of the young wife
would captivate the most callous heart.</p>

<p>And Von Kluyden? This man who devoted himself to intrigue
and rascality for so long, knew not, while he lived, how
otherwise to occupy his time. He was never satisfied. Nemesis
held him fast in her cruel clutches. When the time came for
Hendrik to assert and prove his rights, he did so most successfully;
and that for which Isabella bartered her honor, and beauty,
and youth, passed like sand through the fingers, and was hers no
more. Von Kluyden was successful in nothing that he undertook
to accomplish; the ghost of the murdered Horst followed
him day and night;&mdash;he finally died in a madhouse! Isabella
had, a little while before his dementia, entrusted herself and her
million of money into the hands of a young man of the titled
nobility&mdash;who
in his turn did not love the young widow even for
her marvelous beauty&mdash;but for the <i>thalers</i> and <i>gulden</i> that
brought plenty to his empty coffers and luxury to his impoverished
home. In this marriage Isabella did not find the happiness
she expected to find, and for which she had so long waited.
The Prince squandered her enormous fortune, as Princes are
usually supposed to squander fortunes, in about the half of a
year's duration, and by that time, having found out and enjoyed
all that life held for him of pleasure or excitement, he closed his
career by putting a pistol-ball through his head, early one morning,
while the sun was shining, and the birds were singing, and
flowers were blooming on every side.</p>

<p>So it has come to pass that Isabella&mdash;although not yet twenty-five
years of age, has been twice a widow&mdash;(and a very charming
one she is!) not likely now ever to be aught else! The sale
of her beauty, her honor, her peace of mind, has brought to her,
as a recompense for what she has lost, a varied and rich experience,
which will save her forever hereafter from the chance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
being deceived and betrayed through the tenderest and noblest
impulses of the human heart.</p>

<p>And so the curtain goes down forever between us and those
with whom we have whiled away some pleasant hours, and gathered,
it may be, profit or amusement from their acting on the
stage of life.</p>

<p><i>Voila tout.</i></p>

<h2><a name="MARY_F_CHILDS" id="MARY_F_CHILDS">MARY F. CHILDS</a></h2>


<p>Mrs. Mary Fairfax Childs, maker of dialect verse, was
born at Lexington, Kentucky, May 25, 1846. She is the
daughter of the Rev. Edward Fairfax Berkley (1813-1897),
who was rector of Christ Church, Lexington, for
nineteen years. Dr. Berkley baptized Henry Clay, in
1847, and buried him five years later. Miss Berkley was
a pupil at the Misses Jackson's Seminary for young
ladies until her thirteenth year, or, in 1858, when her
father accepted a call to St. Louis, in which city he labored
for the following forty years. In St. Louis, she continued
her studies at a private school for girls, when
she left prior to her graduation in order to devote herself
more especially to music, Latin, and French. Miss Berkley
was married, in 1870, to William Ward Childs, a returned
Confederate soldier; and in 1884 they removed
to Clinton, Missouri, where they resided for seven years,
when business called them to New York, their home until
Mr. Child's death in 1911. Mrs. Childs's life in New
York was a very busy one. She was prominent in several
social and literary groups; and for many years she was
corresponding secretary of the New York Chapter of the
United Daughters of the Confederacy. Her first poem
that attracted wide attention was entitled <i>De Namin' ob
de Twins</i>, which originally appeared in <i>The Century Magazine</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
for December, 1903. It was the second in a group
of <i>Eleven Negro Songs</i>, written by Joel Chandler Harris,
Grace MacGowan Cooke, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, and
one or two other poets. That Mrs. Childs's masterpiece
was the flower of the flock admits of little question: it is
one of the best negro dialect poems yet written by a Southern
woman. Exactly a year later the same periodical published
her <i>A Christmas Warning</i>, with the well-known
refrain, <i>Roos' high, chicken&mdash;roos' high</i>. These, with
many others, were brought together in an attractive volume,
entitled <i>De Namin' ob de Twins, and Other Sketches
from the Cotton Land</i> (New York, 1908). This collection
is highly esteemed by that rather small company of lovers
of dialect verse. Mrs. Childs's poem, <i>The Boys Who
Wore the Gray</i>, has been printed, and is well-known
throughout the South. She has recently completed another
collection of sketches, called <i>Absolute Monarchy</i>,
which will appear in 1913. At the present time Mrs.
Childs is historian of the Society of Kentucky Women of
New York, although she is residing at Kirkwood, Missouri,
near St. Louis.</p>

<h2><a name="WILLIAM_T_PRICE" id="WILLIAM_T_PRICE">WILLIAM T. PRICE</a></h2>


<p>William Thompson Price, dramatic critic, creator of
playwrights, was born near Louisville, Kentucky, December
17, 1846. He was educated in the private schools
of Louisville, but the Civil War proved more interesting
than text-books, so he ran away with Colonel E. P. Clay,
whom he left, in turn, for John H. Morgan, and Generals
Forrest and Wheeler. He was finally captured and imprisoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
but he, of course, escaped. After the war Mr.
Price went to Germany and studied for three years at the
Universities of Leipzig and Berlin. From 1875 to 1880
he was dramatic critic for the Louisville <i>Courier-Journal</i>;
and the following five years he devoted to editorial work
for various newspapers, and to collecting material for his
enormous biography of the Rev. George O. Barnes, a
noted and eccentric Kentucky evangelist, which appeared
under the title of <i>Without Scrip or Purse</i> (Louisville,
1883). Mr. Price went to New York in the early eighties,
and that city has remained his home to this day. In 1885
he was dramatic critic for the now defunct New York
<i>Star</i>, which he left after a year to become a reader of new
plays for A. M. Palmer, the leading manager of his time,
whom he was associated with for more than twenty years.
Mr. Price's <i>The Technique of the Drama</i> (New York,
1892), gave him a high position among the dramatic writers
of the country. A new edition of it was called for in
1911, and it seems destined to remain the chief authority
in its field for many years. In 1901 Mr. Price became
playreader for Harrison Grey Fiske; and in the same year
he founded the American School of Playwriting, in which
men and women, whom the gods forgot, are transformed
into great dramatists&mdash;perhaps! His second volume
upon the stage, <i>The Analysis of Play Construction and
Dramatic Principle</i> (New York, 1908), is the text-book of
his school. At the present time Mr. Price is editor of
<i>The American Playwright</i>, a monthly magazine of dramatic
discussion.</p>

<p class="center">THE OFFENBACH AND GILBERT OPERAS<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p class="center">[From <i>The Technique of the Drama</i> (New York, 1892)]</p>

<p>The light-hearted genius of Paris composed a new style of
opera for the general merriment of the world. Who can describe
the surprises, the quaintness of song, the drolleries of action
of the Offenbach school? It was the intoxicating wine of music.
Gladstone, when premier of England, found time to say that the
world owed as much in its civilization to the discovery of the
fiddle as it did to steam.</p>

<p>This cannot be applied in its whole sense to Offenbach, but
this master of satire and the sensuous certainly expressed his
times. He set laughter to song. It was democratic. It spared
not king, courtier, or the rabble. It was wisdom and sentiment
in disguise. It was born among despotisms, and jested when
kingdoms fell. It was the stalking horse behind which Offenbach
hunted the follies of the day and bagged the absurdities of
the hour. If it had <i>double entendre</i>, its existence had a double
meaning. Its music and purpose defied national prejudices.
Under its laughter-compelling notes the sober bass-viol put on a
merry disposition, and your cornet-a-piston became a wag. It
was flippant, the glorification of youthful mirth and feelings, and
it made many a melancholy Jacques sing again the song of
Beranger,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Comme je regrette ma jambe si dodu.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is not the purpose here to commend its delirious dances,
but to admit that there was genius in it. In a technical sense
the dramatic part of them are models compared with the inane
and vague compositions of a later school.</p>

<p>The opera bouffe is in a stage beyond decadence, and no longer
regards consistency, even of nonsense, in its dramatic elements.
Some of the conventionalisms of its technique remain.</p>

<p>We hear again and again the old choruses, the drinking songs,
the letter songs, the wine songs, the conspirators' songs, the
departure for the war, the lovers' duets, and what-not, with the
old goblets, the old helmets and all in use; but order is lost, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
the topical song often saves the public patience, apart from the
<i>disjecta membra</i>, upon which are fed the eye and the ear.</p>

<p>The Gilbert opera. The delicate foolery of Gilbert and the
interpreting melody of Sullivan created an inimitable form of
opera that delighted its generations. In its way perfection marks
it. There is much in it that ministers to inward quiet and enjoyment.
"Pinafore," "The Mikado," and all the list, are products
of genius. "Ruddygore" is structurally weak, proving
that even nonsense must have a logical treatment. Successful
in a manner as "Ruddygore" was, it was filled with characteristic
quaintness. We accept Rose Maybud as a piece of good luck,
from the moment her modest slippers demurely patter to the
front; and it is a sober statement to say that our generation has
seen nothing more charming than her artful artlessness and innocence.
She is worthy of Gilbert. His taste is refined beyond
the point of vulgarity in essence or by way of expediency. His
fancy is not tainted with the corruption of flesh-tight limbs, and
he holds fast only to such physical allurements as the "three
little maids just from school" in the "Mikado" or the impossibly
good and dainty Rose Maybud may tempt us with. In the
dance there is no lasciviousness, only joy. Gilbert and Sullivan
have called a halt to the can-can and bid the world be decent.
The whole history of comic opera is filled with proof that music
first consented to lend itself to foolery on condition that there
should be some heart in it; and even Offenbach, the patriarch
of libidinous absurdities, could not get along without stopping
by the wayside to make his sinners sing love-songs filled with
pure emotion.</p>

<p>Rose Maybud is a piece of delicate coquetry with the mysterious
simplicity of maidenhood, giving offense in no way. These authors
are satirists, not burlesquers and fakirs.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="GEORGE_M_DAVIE" id="GEORGE_M_DAVIE">GEORGE M. DAVIE</a></h2>


<p>George Montgomery Davie, a verse-maker of cleverness
and charm, was born near Hopkinsville, Kentucky,
March 16, 1848. He began his collegiate career at Centre
College, Danville, Kentucky, but he later went to Princeton,
from which institution he was graduated in 1868.
Two years later he established himself as a lawyer at
Louisville. Davie rose rapidly in his profession, and he
was soon recognized as one of the ablest lawyers in Kentucky.
Though busy with his practice, he found time to
write verse and short prose papers for periodicals that
were appreciated by many persons. Davie was a Latinist
of decided ability, and he often employed himself in turning
the odes of Horace into English. His original work,
however, is very charming and clever, a smile being concealed
in almost every line he wrote, though it is a very
quiet and dignified smile, never boisterous. He was one
of the founders of the now celebrated Filson Club, of
Louisville. He died at New York, February 22, 1900, but
he sleeps to-day in Louisville's beautiful Cave Hill cemetery.

<h2><a name="JOHN_URI_LLOYD" id="JOHN_URI_LLOYD">JOHN URI LLOYD</a></h2>


<p>John Uri Lloyd, novelist and scientist, was born at West
Bloomfield, New York, April 19, 1849. He is the son of
a civil engineer who came West, in 1853, for the purpose
of surveying a railroad between Covington and Louisville,
known as the "River Route." Mr. Lloyd was thus four
years old when his father settled at Burlington, Boone
county, Kentucky, near the line of the road. The panic
of 1854 came and the railroad company failed, but his
parents preferred their new Kentucky home to the old
home in the East, and they decided to remain, taking up
their first vocations, that of teaching. For several years
they taught in the village schools of the three little Kentucky
towns of Burlington, Petersburg, and Florence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
Mr. Lloyd lived at Florence until he was fourteen
years of age, when he was apprenticed to a Cincinnati
druggist, but he continued to be a resident of Kentucky
until 1876, since which time he has lived at Cincinnati.
In 1878 he became connected with the Cincinnati
College of Pharmacy, and this connection has continued to
the present day. In 1880 he was married to a Kentucky
woman. Mr. Lloyd is one of the most distinguished pharmaceutical
chemists in the United States. He has a magnificent
library and museum upon his subjects; and he is
generally conceded to be the world's highest authority on
puff-balls. Mr. Lloyd's scientific works include <i>The
Chemistry of Medicines</i> (1881); <i>Drugs and Medicines of
North America</i> (1884); <i>King's American Dispensatory</i>
(1885); <i>Elixirs, their History and Preparation</i> (1892);
and he, as president, has edited the publications of the
Lloyd Library, as follows: <i>Dr. B. S. Barton's Collections</i>
(1900); <i>Dr. Peter Smith's Indian Doctor's Dispensatory</i>
(1901); <i>A Study in Pharmacy</i> (1902); <i>Dr. David
Schopf's Materia Medica Americana</i> (1903); <i>Dr. Manasseh
Cutler's Vegetable Productions</i> (1903); <i>Reproductions
from the Works of William Downey, John Carver,
and Anthony St. Storck</i> (1907); <i>Hydrastis Canadensis</i>
(1908); <i>Samuel Thomson and Thomsonian Materia Medica</i>
(1909). Dr. Lloyd has won his general reputation as a
writer of novels descriptive of life in northern Kentucky.
His first work to attract wide attention was entitled <i>Etidorpha,
or the End of Earth</i> (New York, 1895), a work
which involved speculative philosophy. This was followed
by a little story, <i>The Right Side of the Car</i> (Boston,
1897). Then came the Stringtown stories, which made
his reputation. "Stringtown" is the fictional name for
the Kentucky Florence of his boyhood. There are four
of them: <i>Stringtown on the Pike</i> (New York, 1900); <i>Warwick
of the Knobs</i> (New York, 1901); <i>Red Head</i> (New
York, 1903); and <i>Scroggins</i> (New York, 1904). In these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
stories the author's aim was not to be engaged solely as a
novelist, "but to portray to outsiders a phase of life unknown
to the world at large, and to establish a folk-lore
picture in which the scenes that occurred in times gone by,
would be paralleled in the events therein narrated."
<i>Stringtown on the Pike</i> is Mr. Lloyd's best known book,
but <i>Warwick of the Knobs</i> is far and way the finest of the
four.</p>

<p class="center">[From <i>Warwick of the Knobs</i> (New York, 1901)]</p>

<p>Warwick made no movement; no word of greeting came from
his lips, no softening touch to his furrowed brow, no sparkle to
his cold, gray eye. As though gazing upon a stranger, he sat and
pierced the girl through and through with a formal stare, that
drove despair deeper into her heart and caused her to cling closer
to her brother.</p>

<p>"Pap, sister's home ag'in," the youth repeated.</p>

<p>"I know nothing of a sister who claims a home here."</p>

<p>Mary would have fallen but for the strong arm of her brother,
who gently, tenderly guided her to a great rocking-chair. Then
he turned on his father.</p>

<p>"I said thet sister's home agin, and I means it, pap."</p>

<p>Turning the leaves of the Book to a familiar passage, Warwick
read aloud:</p>

<p>"'The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of
life is not of the Father, but of the world.' This girl has no
home here. She is of the world."</p>

<p>"Father, ef sister hes no home here, I hav'n't none, either.
Ef she must go out into the world, I'll go with her."</p>

<p>The man of God gazed sternly at the rebellious youth. Then
he turned to the girl.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span></p>
<p>"The good Book says, 'A fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou
be in the earth.'"</p>

<p>Joshua stepped between the two and hid the child from her
father.</p>

<p>"Pap, thet book says tough things to-night. The text you
preached from to-day was a better one. I remember et, and I'll
leave et to you ef I am not right. 'I am merciful, saith the
Lord, and I will not keep my anger forever.' Thet's a better
text, and I takes et, God was in a better humor when He wrote
et."</p>

<p>"Joshua!" spoke the father, shocked at his son's irreverence.</p>

<p>"Listen, pap. I hate to say et, but I must. You preached one
thing this morning, and you acts another thing now. Didn't
you say thet God 'retaineth not His anger forever, because He
delighteth in mercy?' I may not hev the words right, but I've
got the sense."</p>

<p>"My son!"</p>

<p>"Pap, I axes the question on the square. Ain't thet what
you preached?"</p>

<p>"That was the text."</p>

<p>"It ain't fair to preach one text in the meetin'-house and act
another text at home."</p>

<p>"Joshua!"</p>

<p>"Let's hev the mercy text to-night. Pap, sister's home ag'in.
Let's act the fergivin' text out."</p>

<p>Joshua stepped aside and the minister, touched in spite of
himself, glanced at his daughter, a softened glance, that spoke of
affection, but he made no movement. Then the girl slowly rose
and turned toward the door, still keeping her eyes on her father's
face. She edged backward step by step toward the door by
which she had entered. Her hand grasped the latch; the door
moved on its hinges.</p>

<p>"Stop, sister," said Joshua. "Pap, ef sister opens thet door
I go with her, and then you will sit alone in this room ferever.
You will be the last Warwick of the Knob."</p>

<p>Warwick, with all his coldness and strength, could not stand
the ordeal.</p>

<p>"Come back, my children," he said. "It is also written, 'I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their
iniquities will I remember no more.'" And then, as in former
times, Mary's head rested on her father's knee.</p>

thinks Dr. Walker informed him it was in 1752, but Col. Shelby states implicitly
that, in 1779 in company with Dr. Walker on Yellow creek a mile or
two from Cumberland mountain, the Doctor observed "upon that tree,"
pointing to a beech across the road to the left hand, "Ambrose Powell marked his name and the date of the year." I examined the tree and
found <i>A. Powell 1750</i> cut in legible characters.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> This reply was made in answer to one of Randolph's ranting Yazoo
philippics, several of which are among the bitterest speeches ever heard
in Congress. Lyon at this time (1804) was a member of Congress from
Kentucky. The Yazoo land grant frauds had aroused the public mind, and a
commission had endeavored to settle by compromise the claims of Georgia,
and those holding under the Georgia act of 1795, to the vast territory in
dispute. Randolph denounced the frauds committed, and opposed any
settlement of the controversy, while Lyon desired to see the country settled,
and the compromise of the commissioners carried out.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> This reply to Randolph was made in the House of Representatives, in
1824, in the course of the debate between Clay and Randolph. "During the
session of 1823-4, attempts wore made to run at Mr. Clay, on account of his
peculiar situation in being named for the presidency while Speaker of the
House of Representatives, and for his zealous support of the American system.
In a debate on an improvement bill he encountered Mr. Randolph of
Virginia, who had endeavored to provoke him to reply," and the bit of the
debate reproduced here is the answer the gentleman from Virginia received
for his pains.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> After the above address, La Fayette rose, and in a tone influenced by
powerful feeling, made an eloquent reply. In 1824 La Fayette visited the
United States, as "the guest of the Nation," and he was gladly welcomed
in many parts of the country. And "on the tenth of December, 1824, he
was introduced in the House of Representatives by a committee appointed
for that purpose. The general, being conducted to the sofa placed for his
reception, the Speaker (Mr. Clay), addressed him" in the very happy words
given above.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
